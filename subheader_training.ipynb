This activity will build on USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s previous investments in health system '\", \"b'strengthening and lessons learned from other stakeholders; and further contribute to the Royal '\", \"b'Government of Cambodia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (RGC) upcoming Health Strategic Plan phase 4 (HSP4) in light of the '\", \"b'decentralization policy. This activity will work with national and subnational health systems to '\", \"b'strengthen the implementation of national policies and standards to improve private sector quality '\", \"b'monitoring systems, and to improve the capacity of providers and institutions to provide better and '\", \"b'more sustainable healthcare services. These include, where permissible and within USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'manageable interest, assisting to build an overarching enabling environment for Private Sector '\", \"b'Engagement (PSE); and providing high quality priority health services, including maternal, '\", \"b'newborn and child health, reproductive health, and infectious diseases. '\", \"b'II. BACKGROUND '\", \"b'A. '\", \"b'Country Context '\", \"b'Cambodia has made significant improvements on its health indicators, achieving 2015 Millennium '\", \"b'Development Goal targets for infant mortality, under-five mortality, maternal mortality, '\", \"b'tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS ahead of schedule. However, gaps remain. Maternal and newborn '\", \"b'mortality rates are still among the highest in Southeast Asia. Twenty percent of children are still '\", \"b'stunted from poor nutrition, the decline in new HIV infections among key populations is not on '\", \"b'track to meet targets, and Cambodia remains among the countries with the highest burden of '\", \"b'tuberculosis. Across the health system, quality of care is a barrier to improved health outcomes. '\", \"b'Quality healthcare is defined by WHO to include seven attributes1: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f effective - evidence-based '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f safe - avoiding harm to people for whom the care is intended '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f people-centered \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 responsive to individual preferences, needs and values '\", \"b'1 https://www.who.int/health-topics/quality-of-care#tab=tab_1 '\", \"b'Page 4 of 60 '\", \"b'72044223RFA00001 '\", \"b'USAID Enhancing Quality of Healthcare Activity II (EQHA II) '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f timely \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 reducing waiting times and harmful delays '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f equitable \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 providing care that does not vary in quality on account of gender, ethnicity, '\", \"b'geographic location, and socio-economic status '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f integrated \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 providing care that makes available the full range of health services throughout '\", \"b'the life course '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f efficient \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 maximizing the benefit of available resources and avoiding waste '\", \"b'Cross-Cutting Health System '\", \"b'The current health sector programs are guided by the Health Strategic Plan 2016-2020 (HSP3), '\", \"b'which is the third medium term plan of the health sector. Progress in improved service coverage and '\", \"b'quality have been observed and mechanisms to support the assessment and monitoring quality have '\", \"b'been established in the public sector. Given the rapid growth of private providers with insufficient '\", \"b'regulation measures, and although MoH support will continue to focus on advancing safety and '\", \"b'quality of healthcare through public health systems. To maximize the health outcomes of the '\", \"b'Cambodian people, the interventions should consider strengthening quality of healthcare in the '\", \"b'private sector where the majority of care seeking occurs. These interventions include building '\", \"b'governance and institutional structures and capacity to direct and support quality improvement '\", \"b'efforts in synergized and harmonized manners; building and implementing the Cambodian National '\", \"b'Health Accreditation System (CNHAS) for both public and private health facilities in sequenced '\", \"b'phases; and improving functional compliance mechanisms by setting out and implementing '\", \"b'minimum standards for service quality and safety as guided by the national policies and guidelines. '\", \"b'Significant challenges constrain the health sector\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ability to improve access to quality healthcare '\", \"b'services for Cambodians. Lack of universal health insurance coverage, and its links to quality '\", \"b'assurance of healthcare services still require Cambodians to spend high levels out-of-pocket for '\", \"b'variable quality healthcare.  '\", \"b'In addition, despite MOH efforts to mainstream gender throughout health sector policies and '\", \"b'practices, significant gaps remain. A significant area for attention includes addressing the lack of '\", \"b'adequate and coordinated care and services for GBV survivors. Health managers and providers have '\", \"b'limited understanding on gender responsiveness and social inclusion, which remain priority '\", \"b'challenges to achieve gender equity in the Cambodian health sector. '\", \"b'According to CDHS 2014, 67% of Cambodian household members visited private sector providers '\", \"b'for their first time treatment of illnesses or injuries. While some services with acceptable quality '\", \"b'exist, especially in not-for-profit facilities, quality controls for private services are still lacking. The '\", \"b'private sector remains poorly regulated mainly because the laws and implementation guidelines are '\", \"b'still underdeveloped, there is a lack of quality assurance standards, and a lack of enforcement for '\", \"b'the implementation of existing laws. Common quality concerns in the private sector include '\", \"b'misdiagnosis, mistreatment and under-referral, including for infectious disease cases, to appropriate '\", \"b'Page 5 of 60 '\", \"b'72044223RFA00001 '\", \"b'USAID Enhancing Quality of Healthcare Activity II (EQHA II) '\", \"b'healthcare facilities. Over-reliance on tertiary care at private facilities and overtreatment is a major '\", \"b'contributor to Cambodia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s high out-of-pocket costs. '\", \"b'The capacity of private providers varies according to each health profession. Private pharmacies are '\", \"b'a major source for healthcare seeking due to their geographic proximity, convenient opening hours, '\", \"b'availability of a range of medicines, simple and quick care, and low cost (no consultation fee) '\", \"b'compared to private health facilities. The provision of treatment may not fully comply with the '\", \"b'national guidance and recommended doses, especially for pharmacy staff who are consistently '\", \"b'present at the pharmacies and provide treatment or advice to patients, but who have been largely left '\", \"b'out of training on updated diagnosis and treatment guidelines set by different national programs. '\", \"b'The introduction of the continuing professional development (CPD) for in-service training for '\", \"b'healthcare providers according to the CPD policy-framework is still at an early stage and not well '\", \"b'integrated with the national programs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 training. As most healthcare providers are dual practice '\", \"b'(operating in both public and private sectors), they may receive updated training as a public '\", \"b'provider. However, their actual application of trained skills at their private practice is not well '\", \"b'monitored for compliance. '\", \"b'Getting the private sector on board towards better healthcare quality has been a challenge in the '\", \"b'past, likely due to a lack of coordinating mechanism and influenced by the widespread element of '\", \"b'dual practice. Greater engagement with the private sector in the development of a quality '\", \"b'framework and system development is key to securing their support and commitment to national '\", \"b'efforts toward enhancement of quality healthcare.  '\", \"b'Implementation of regulations for both practitioners in public and private facilities, implementation '\", \"b'of H-EQIP II for public systems, and a strong accreditation system are needed to bring the quality '\", \"b'of Cambodian healthcare up to regional standards. There is opportunity for the accreditation system '\", \"b'to provide incentives for private providers by publicly recognizing providers that are accredited and '\", \"b'operate according to quality standards. The RGC direction to expand social health insurance toward '\", \"b'UHC, and the implementation of strategic purchasing, will also serve as motivating factors for '\", \"b'improvement of healthcare services in Cambodia through conditional contracting by the insurance '\", \"b'institutions. '\", \"b'Maternal and Child Health '\", \"b'The 2021 Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey shows continuing progress in maternal and '\", \"b'child health with the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) at 154 per 100,000 live births, under-five '\", \"b'mortality and neonatal mortality rates of 15 and 8 per 1,000 live births respectively. However, '\", \"b'Cambodia missed the MMR target of 130 per 100,000 live births in 2020. Therefore, extra effort is '\", \"b'needed to achieve the new health target of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.1 to lower the '\", \"b'MMR to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. While the 2021 CDHS shows almost all deliveries '\", \"b'(99%) and 85% of postnatal visits were attended by skilled birth attendants, the quality of services '\", \"b'Page 6 of 60 '\", \"b'72044223RFA00001 '\", \"b'USAID Enhancing Quality of Healthcare Activity II (EQHA II) '\", \"b'should be improved. Cambodia developed and implemented two consecutive Emergency Obstetric '\", \"b'and Newborn Care (EmONC) Improvement Plans for the periods of 2010-2015 and 2016-2020. The '\", \"b'EmONC assessment and reviews in 2020 showed the increased number of Comprehensive EmONC '\", \"b'Care (CEmONC) and Basic EmONC (BEmONC) facilities. However, Cambodia still has fewer '\", \"b'than half of the recommended number of functioning EmONC facilities for the country and '\", \"b'EmONC facilities are still largely concentrated at the hospital level and in urban areas, with one '\", \"b'province still lacking any EmONC facilities. The needs of newborns with complications are also '\", \"b'insufficiently met. The same assessment showed that 31.6% of the expected number of women who '\", \"b'will develop complications were treated in functional EmONC facilities while 0.44% of women '\", \"b'treated with obstetric complications in those facilities died. It also showed 1.2% of births in all '\", \"b'facilities surveyed were stillborn or died in the early neonatal period. In order to address these and '\", \"b'other remaining challenges, a new EmONC Improvement Plan is being proposed for the period '\", \"b'2021-2025. '\", \"b'Family Planning and Reproductive Health (FP/RH) '\", \"b'Significant progress has been made for reproductive health and family planning (FP) in Cambodia, '\", \"b'but training and quality assurance of health providers on method mix and FP quality assurance (QA) '\", \"b'and Quality Improvement (QI) tools still remain a focus of the Ministry of Health (MoH). Capacity '\", \"b'of service providers, particularly on long acting and permanent methods continue to be challenges. '\", \"b'New staff and new FP method introduction require ongoing in-service education to equip them to '\", \"b'provide FP services. A shortage of skilled providers, and common myths and misconceptions are '\", \"b'leading people to rely on traditional methods. The 2021 Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey '\", \"b'(CDHS) shows that 12% of currently married women have an unmet need for family planning '\", \"b'services, 45% were using modern methods and 17% traditional methods. Among currently married '\", \"b'women, the contraceptive pill is the most commonly used method (26%), followed by injection '\", \"b'(6%), and Intrauterine Devices (5%).  '\", \"b'Tuberculosis (TB) '\", \"b'With USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s contribution, significant progress has been made in the TB control program in '\", \"b'Cambodia with the reduction of TB incidence by 50% from 2000 to 2018 according to a WHO '\", \"b'report. The estimated TB incidence in Cambodia declined from 575/100,000 in 2000 to '\", \"b'423/100,000 in 2011 and 274/100,000 in 2020. In 2021, the National TB Program (NTP) reported '\", \"b'21,627 cases of TB, a significant decrease compared to 2020. While there have been successes in '\", \"b'the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in '\", \"b'Cambodia, case detection of all types of TB remains a challenge, with almost 50% of cases going '\", \"b'undetected, which illustrates a large gap in case notification. '\", \"b'There are several factors that contribute to the high number of undetected cases, which include '\", \"b'inaccessibility of health care services at the community level, lack of knowledge and awareness of '\", \"b'Page 7 of 60 '\", \"b'72044223RFA00001 '\", \"b'USAID Enhancing Quality of Healthcare Activity II (EQHA II) '\", \"b'the symptoms of TB, sub-optimal screening and referral at referral hospitals and health centers, and '\", \"b'the limited roles of the private sector in these efforts. The burden of MDR-TB in Cambodia is low '\", \"b'and NTP identified 72 cases in 2021 which are still undetected.  '\", \"b'TB services are mainly provided by the public sector, yet little information is known on the private '\", \"b'sector\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s role in TB control. Recently, the national TB program involved pharmacies and private '\", \"b'clinics in selected ODs to refer presumptive TB patients to diagnose and treat at public health '\", \"b'facilities. In 2022, NTP has developed the national TB Public Private Mix Operational Guideline '\", \"b'2021 - 2030, which highlights different modalities of private providers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 roles in screening, diagnosis '\", \"b'and treatment of TB patients. Based on this guideline and the scale of the private sector and their '\", \"b'role in health care has increased, they have potential capacity to better support NTP in accelerating '\", \"b'TB case finding and provision of TB services.  '\", \"b'Malaria '\", \"b'USAID, through the President\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Malaria Initiative (PMI), provides technical assistance in malaria '\", \"b'by strengthening control, elimination, and surveillance activities, as well as monitoring drug '\", \"b'resistance. These programs have contributed to significantly reducing malaria morbidity and '\", \"b'mortality in Cambodia over the last 10 years, with zero deaths from malaria since 2018. While '\", \"b'malaria rates have dropped dramatically, finding and treating the last remaining malaria cases is a '\", \"b'challenge for the national malaria control program and partners. Efforts will focus on expanding '\", \"b'screening, social behavior change approaches, and malaria prevention at the community level in '\", \"b'forested areas to reach the 2025 elimination target. As Cambodia approaches malaria elimination, it '\", \"b'is important to ensure the availability of capacities and resources needed to prevent, detect, and '\", \"b'efficiently respond to malaria cases. The focus will shift more towards integration of key vertical '\", \"b'systems (information, supply chain, financing, etc.) into the wider health system, and integration of '\", \"b'Village Malaria Workers into a wider Community Health Work platform. '\", \"b'HIV/AIDS '\", \"b'Cambodia has made significant progress in controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic in recent years. '\", \"b'USAID has helped reduce the adult HIV prevalence from 1.7 percent in 1998 to 0.6 percent in 2020 '\", \"b'by improving the quality of HIV services, developing innovative ways of finding the last cases and '\", \"b'improving the cost effectiveness and sustainability of the HIV response. These efforts have '\", \"b'contributed towards achieving a tenfold reduction in new infections, from 11,000 to 1,100 per year. '\", \"b'Today, 84% of the estimated 75,000 Cambodians living with HIV know their status, 99% are on '\", \"b'medication to control the virus, and 97% of those on medication are virally suppressed, which '\", \"b'greatly reduces their risk to transmit the virus. Ending the epidemic will require finding the '\", \"b'estimated 12,000 people living with HIV who remain undiagnosed and linking them to treatment. '\", \"b'Two thirds of new infections occur among key populations and their sexual partners. Reducing new '\", \"b'Page 8 of 60 '\", \"b'72044223RFA00001 '\", \"b'USAID Enhancing Quality of Healthcare Activity II (EQHA II) '\", \"b'infections will also require expanding targeted prevention to key populations, particularly through '\", \"b'the provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication. '\", \"b'In the private sector, availability of HIV services remains limited, with insufficient referrals or '\", \"b'sharing of data between public and private sectors. In the public sector, HIV services are largely '\", \"b'delivered though vertical parallel systems financed by international donors. Ongoing challenges that '\", \"b'EQHA II may address include the need to integrate HIV into the national system and increase '\", \"b'access and quality care in the private sector. '\", \"b'Global Health Security '\", \"b'The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the ability of emerging pathogens to cause '\", \"b'significant public health, economic and societal disruption in all regions of the world, as well as the '\", \"b'inadequate preparedness for events of this scale. Before COVID-19, there have been many other '\", \"b'epidemics that have posed similar threats including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), '\", \"b'avian influenza in 2005, novel pandemic influenza in 2009 and the emergence of Middle East '\", \"b'Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012. Much effort has been applied to prevention, detection and '\", \"b'response for COVID-19 in Cambodia by the MOH, leading the effort, and by partners and donors. '\", \"b'However, there is a need to strengthen cross-sectoral collaboration, increase respiratory pathogen '\", \"b'and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance, improve the implementation of best practices for '\", \"b'disease detection and response at health facilities, and address the drivers of disease with a focus on '\", \"b'prevention.  '\", \"b'While there have been some improvements in Cambodia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s capacity to exercise emergency response '\", \"b'plans for disease outbreaks, according to the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) 20212 data, '\", \"b'Cambodia has an index score of 33 out of 100 for AMR practices, the same score as 2019, '\", \"b'illustrating no improvement in practices over the past three years. A recent study3 of public '\", \"b'knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) around AMR in Cambodia highlighted the need for '\", \"b'outreach that is targeted to the local context and partners with trusted healthcare providers.  '\", \"b'Cambodia was given an index score of zero for biosafety and biosecurity in the GHSI 2021 report, '\", \"b'demonstrating that there is much need for improved practices in labs and health facilities. While '\", \"b'more data and analysis is needed on the capacity of human resources for health in this area, there is '\", \"b'indication that there is great need to increase availability of trained healthcare workers that are able '\", \"b'to prevent, detect, and respond to diseases with epidemic potential.

'\", \"b'To achieve this purpose, EQHA II will support the implementation of key priorities identified by '\", \"b'MOH and other health stakeholders towards achieving universal health coverage, primarily through '\", \"b'a focus on health systems advancements, addressing the challenges of reproductive, maternal, and '\", \"b'child health and communicable disease, and making progress on the governance, regulation, and '\", \"b'compliance agenda. Health systems advancements call for increasing acceptability and '\", \"b'accountability of health services, particularly at the subnational level. EQHA II\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s focus will include '\", \"b'strengthening the health workforce, supporting effective governance and regulatory compliance, '\", \"b'and using digital tools to increase effectiveness and efficiency of the health system.

'\", \"b'The Activity will support plans and strategies to promote the integration of national vertical '\", \"b'programs into the mainstream health systems where possible. The activity will also strengthen '\", \"b'policies of vertical programs, particularly for MCH, FP, and TB. The analysis and improvement of '\", \"b'health system policy will have to consider other factors including greater private sector '\", \"b'involvement, human resource development and management, capacity of the subnational systems to '\", \"b'lead and monitor the improvement process, patient-centered services, communities of practice '\", \"b'among healthcare providers and managers, and community participation. The effective '\", \"b'implementation of set policies by the national institutions at subnational levels will depend '\", \"b'significantly on the clear standards provided by the national levels. Therefore, the Activity will '\", \"b'implement this approach with strengthened coordination at national level and in line with the RGC '\", \"b'Decentralization and Deconcentration (D&D) policy. These interventions will work in coordination '\", \"b'with the implementation of H-EQIP II and the Global Fund-funded activities within the public '\", \"b'health system.

'\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f PHB: The Promoting Healthy Behavior (PHB) project, led by PSI, is active until June 2025 '\", \"b'to promote individual healthy practice on maternal and child health, nutrition, family '\", \"b'planning, TB, malaria and non-communicable disease. The project is working to create '\", \"b'Page 15 of 60 '\", \"b'72044223RFA00001 '\", \"b'USAID Enhancing Quality of Healthcare Activity II (EQHA II) '\", \"b'demand at community level to adopt healthy behaviors and strengthen the linkage between '\", \"b'communities and health facilities.  '\", \"b'EQHA II will also coordinate and collaborate with other partners and donors active in health '\", \"b'systems strengthening and healthcare quality improvement in Cambodia, particularly the H-EQIP II '\", \"b'project, funded with pooled funding from RGC, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, German '\", \"b'Government, Korea International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank. This project uses a '\", \"b'multipronged approach to strengthen the health system with emphasis on supporting improvements '\", \"b'in quality of care via routine quality assessments in public health systems using the National Quality '\", \"b'Enhancement Monitoring (NQEM) tools, improving the availability of critical infrastructure, '\", \"b'strengthening public financial management, and incentivizing improvements in the quality of care '\", \"b'through Service Delivery Grants (SDG) to health facilities and health management nationwide '\", \"b'based on quality assessment results.  '\", \"b'EQHA II may also collaborate with the Korean Foundation for International Healthcare (KOFIH), '\", \"b'which works on quality improvement in select provinces and the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and '\", \"b'Malaria (GFATM). For interventions using funding from PEPFAR, PMI and the TB Accelerator, '\", \"b'the project may be expected to collaborate with their counterpart prime recipients and technical '\", \"b'assistance providers. For example, the President\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Malaria Initiative would be expected to '\", \"b'coordinate with UNOPS.  '\", \"b'VI. GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS '\", \"b'This Activity will build upon the previous investment of USAID programs in supporting the reform '\", \"b'of health systems, especially managers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and providers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 capacity and policies for improved quality of '\", \"b'health services in both public and private sectors. The proposed interventions will take place at the '\", \"b'national and subnational levels. The focus on selected provinces should be on the development of '\", \"b'enhanced quality improvement and management models, where the implementation of the new law '\", \"b'on health services management can be implemented and enforced, and lessons learned can be fed '\", \"b'into national systems. The activities should focus on various health facility levels and types, and '\", \"b'link with community health networks. In remote geographical areas with lower quality '\", \"b'improvement, the interventions should demonstrate how access to healthcare services can be '\", \"b'increased by coordination with other stakeholders in addition to the quality improvement efforts. '\", \"b'The activity should cover at least 10 focus provinces. The package of interventions may vary by '\", \"b'province, according to context and need. Focus provinces should be selected in consultation with '\", \"b'USAID based on RGC and PHD interest and commitment; potential to increase equitable outcomes '\", \"b'for indigenous and ethnic minority populations; presence and organization of the private health '\", \"b'sector; and EQHA focus provinces that could benefit from further investment (for example, '\", \"b'Battambang, Kampong Cham, Tbong Khmum, and Kampong Chhnang). '\", \"b'VII. CROSS-CUTTING THEMES '\", \"b'Page 16 of 60 '\", \"b'72044223RFA00001 '\", \"b'USAID Enhancing Quality of Healthcare Activity II (EQHA II) '\", \"b'Private Sector Engagement '\", \"b'This activity will align with USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Private Sector Engagement Policy and use market-based '\", \"b'approaches, where appropriate, to increase the impact and sustainability of interventions. Private '\", \"b'sector engagement (PSE) is a strategic approach to planning and programming through which '\", \"b'USAID consults, strategizes, aligns, collaborates, and implements with the private sector for greater '\", \"b'scale, sustainability, and effectiveness of development or humanitarian outcomes. This may include '\", \"b'engaging with private service providers, supply chain entities, retailers, investors, financial '\", \"b'institutions, and information/communications technology providers. This activity will focus on '\", \"b'supporting private providers, facilities, networks and professional associations to comply with '\", \"b'minimum licensing and accreditation standards and self-regulate to further improve quality. It will '\", \"b'also work to improve coordination between public and private sectors, improve stewardship and '\", \"b'oversight of the private sector by the public sector, and strengthen private service delivery in '\", \"b'priority health areas. '\", \"b'Gender and Inclusive Development  '\", \"b'All interventions must be developed and implemented by taking into account gender and inclusive '\", \"b'development. Inclusive development interventions combat stigma and discrimination, promote '\", \"b'empowerment and inclusion of marginalized or underrepresented groups, and improve the lives of '\", \"b'populations in high-risk situations. The Activity will align its activities with the USAID Gender '\", \"b'Equality and Female Empowerment Policy, the RGC\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Gender Mainstream National Policy, and '\", \"b'USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Policy on Promoting the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. As applicable, the Activity will '\", \"b'work with the Gender Mainstreaming Action Group (GMAG) of MOH to advocate for more '\", \"b'population-based data disaggregation by sex to address the lack of data on gender gaps, and with '\", \"b'specific tracking of data to address challenges for marginalized groups, such as indigenous '\", \"b'populations, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQI+, the elderly and others. '\", \"b'The Activity will advocate with relevant ministries and committees to expand the facilities that '\", \"b'provide GBV-sensitive services to survivors, such as medical care, and referral for legal support and '\", \"b'rehabilitation services; and provide technical assistance in line with this direction from the RGC. '\", \"b'The Activity will also work with GMAG to provide training and capacity building to health care '\", \"b'managers and health care providers to mainstream gender and inclusion into the healthcare systems '\", \"b'with supportive supervision practices.  '\", \"b'Approximately ten percent of Cambodia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s total population are ethnic minorities (the Cham, people '\", \"b'of Vietnamese descent, the Chinese, and at least 17 other ethnic groups or indigenous peoples). '\", \"b'These groups often experience discrimination, social isolation, and economic exclusion. '\", \"b'Northeastern provinces including Ratanakiri, Kratie, Mondulkiri, Preah Vihear and Kampong Thom '\", \"b'have the largest populations of indigenous peoples in the country. Some health outcomes in these '\", \"b'provinces lag behind the national average, for example childhood vaccination rates and child '\", \"b'Page 17 of 60 '\", \"b'72044223RFA00001 '\", \"b'USAID Enhancing Quality of Healthcare Activity II (EQHA II) '\", \"b'nutrition. This activity will target geographic areas and tailor interventions to improve quality of '\", \"b'healthcare and health outcomes for ethnic minorities and indigenous populations. '\", \"b'Localization/ New Partnership Initiative (NPI) '\", \"b'USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s New Partnerships Initiative (NPI) seeks to improve collaboration with new, '\", \"b'nontraditional, and local actors, while enhancing local leadership, capacity, and accountability. In '\", \"b'order to better achieve its objectives sustainably, this activity will engage local, new and '\", \"b'nontraditional partners through sub-awards, capacity building, and other forms of engagement. '\", \"b'Partnerships should include focus on expanding outreach to populations that have historically been '\", \"b'marginalized, including indigenous populations and ethnic minorities. Partnering with local '\", \"b'organizations can make USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s interventions and health facility services more responsive and '\", \"b'accountable to local people, strengthen feedback systems between communities and facilities, and '\", \"b'community participation in quality monitoring. '\", \"b'Sustainability '\", \"b'Sustainability is a key focus of this Activity and all its sub-activities. The proposed interventions '\", \"b'should provide clear strategies for making quality improvement efforts initiated by the Activity '\", \"b'sustainable, with a sustainability plan and milestones. To achieve this goal, interventions must be '\", \"b'country-owned, promoting public and private partnership, led and leaving lasting and integrated '\", \"b'impacts at the Activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s end -- including the ability of host country institutions to carry out '\", \"b'effective quality improvement interventions without external assistance. The Activity will '\", \"b'implement a collaborative approach with national and subnational stakeholders including RGC, '\", \"b'civil society, private sector and key development partners of H-EQIP II, the Global Fund, and other '\", \"b'donors. The focus on systems strengthening, policy, and capacity building made throughout this '\", \"b'program description is purposely intended to support this principle. To the extent possible, the '\", \"b'Activity will build upon, strengthen, and complement existing quality improvement systems, '\", \"b'including those implemented under H-EQIP II, and not create parallel systems. This Activity should '\", \"b'provide high quality technical assistance to increase the acceptability of new policies among '\", \"b'stakeholders and RGC to be incorporated into the national policy. '\", \"b'Collaborating, Learning, and Adapting  '\", \"b'Collaborating, Learning, and Adapting (CLA) is a set of practices that help us improve our '\", \"b'development effectiveness. The activity should partner with other key organizations to promote '\", \"b'synergy and reduce duplication. Learning has always been part of USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work. The Activity will '\", \"b'focus on the best approach and strategy for knowledge management from the grassroots to national '\", \"b'level to learn about results and impact at scale. The offeror should, in consultation with USAID, '\", \"b'develop a set of learning questions from the initial stage of the award and adapt approaches based '\", \"b'on lessons learned throughout the project.  '\", \"b'Digital Health '\", \"b'Page 18 of 60 '\", \"b'72044223RFA00001 '\", \"b'USAID Enhancing Quality of Healthcare Activity II (EQHA II) '\", \"b'In line with the forthcoming Digital Health Strategy of the RGC, EQHA II should pursue '\", \"b'opportunities to use digital approaches and applications as part of the solutions to meet the intended '\", \"b'program goal and objectives and in alignment with digital best practices as laid out in USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'Vision for Action in Digital Health and Digital Investment Principles. Digital tools offer '\", \"b'opportunities to improve effectiveness and efficiency of health system interventions, and offer a '\", \"b'wide range of benefits to service providers, their institutions and beneficiaries. Digital technologies '\", \"b'can be used to improve provider capacity, effective diagnosis and treatment of diseases, interaction '\", \"b'between providers and patients, patient-centered care, disease-surveillance, program M&E, and '\", \"b'strengthen referral linkages. It can also support evidence-based decision making and improve '\", \"b'coordination among care providers and technical support institutions. EQHA II should work with '\", \"b'key stakeholders to use digital solutions to address the challenges of above areas, which are related '\", \"b'to quality improvement and assurance, interoperability between systems, digital global goods, '\", \"b'country ownership, and sustainability of digital systems.

This supports USAID/Cambodia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'strategy to shift from direct service delivery.  '\", \"b'This activity is planned to be a cooperative agreement awarded through full-and-open '\", \"b'competition.  The total estimated USAID contribution to the EQHA II activity is about '\", \"b' of the opportunity module, which will come from FY 2022 to '\", \"b'FY 2026 Global Health Program (GHP-USAID), with an initial obligation of '\", \"b'in FY '\", \"b'  BUREAU/MISSION/PROJECT '\", \"b'2    '\", \"b'USAID 216 IEE TEMPLATE VERSION 1, DECEMBER 2017 '\", \"b'2022 funds.  The activity will have an expected duration of 5 years, beginning on or around June '\", \"b'30, 2023. '\", \"b'To achieve this purpose, EQHA II will support the implementation of key priorities identified by '\", \"b'MOH and other health stakeholders towards achieving universal health coverage, primarily '\", \"b'through a focus on health systems advancements, addressing the challenges of reproductive, '\", \"b'maternal, and child health and communicable disease, and making progress on the '\", \"b'governance, regulation, and compliance agenda. Health systems advancements call for '\", \"b'increasing acceptability and accountability of health services, particularly at the subnational '\", \"b'level. EQHA II\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s focus will include strengthening the health workforce, supporting effective '\", \"b'governance and regulatory compliance, and using digital tools to increase effectiveness and '\", \"b'efficiency of the health system. EQHA II has the following objectives:  '\", \"b'Objective 1: Improved evidence-based policy, guidelines, and strategies for more effective and '\", \"b'efficient health service systems. '\", \"b'The Activity will provide technical assistance and facilitate systems thinking among key '\", \"b'stakeholders, including coordinating institutions and national programs/centers, to use evidence '\", \"b'for policy analysis, develop joint plans or strategies for advocacy, and implementation aimed at '\", \"b'improving the quality and availability of healthcare services at all levels. The Activity will support '\", \"b'plans and strategies to promote the integration of national vertical programs into the mainstream '\", \"b'health systems where possible. The activity will also strengthen policies of vertical programs, '\", \"b'particularly for Maternal Child Health (MCH), Family Planning (FP), and Tuberculosis (TB).  The '\", \"b'effective implementation of set policies by the national institutions at subnational levels will '\", \"b'depend significantly on the clear standards provided by the national levels.

'\", \"b'Illustrative Results: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f '\", \"b'Result 1.1: Policies, guidelines and strategies of national programs are coordinated and '\", \"b'integrated with the Ministry of Health (MoH), and incorporate health system thinking. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f '\", \"b'Result 1.2: Policies, guidelines and strategies addressing specific program areas (such '\", \"b'as MCH, FP, and TB) are improved, in line with international and country-specific best '\", \"b'practices and approaches. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f '\", \"b'Result 1.3: Documented use of data and evidence for quality improvement, leading to '\", \"b'more effective planning, monitoring and evaluation, and decision making. '\", \"b'Objective 2: Improved individual and institutional capacity of the public and private sectors to '\", \"b'implement, monitor and evaluate quality assurance according to the national standards. '\", \"b'The Activity will build on current USAID programming, which seeks to improve national and '\", \"b'local capacity to provide safe, timely, quality, and effective health services across the '\", \"b'continuum of healthcare needs. The Activity will continue to build the capacity of the private '\", \"b'sector, which should be better engaged, regulated, and recognized by the Royal Government '\", \"b'of Cambodia/Ministry of Health (RGC/MOH). The Activity will support the implementation of '\", \"b'existing and new regulations and accreditation laws in the health sector.

'\", \"b'EQHA II will also support expanding professional networks in the public and private sectors '\", \"b'that can foster technical exchange among healthcare professionals, and compile information as '\", \"b'a technical resource center from which healthcare institutions of both sectors can refer and '\", \"b'seek technical assistance or services when needed for their quality improvement efforts. '\", \"b'Illustrative Results: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f '\", \"b'Result 2.1: Strengthened systems of national and subnational institutions to manage '\", \"b'licensing and accreditation of health services. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f '\", \"b'Result 2.2: Improved capacity of health providers and managers to monitor and improve '\", \"b'facility quality, self-regulate, and meet licensing and accreditation standards. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f '\", \"b'Result 2.3: Improved organization of the private sector and coordination with the public '\", \"b'sector at national and subnational levels to develop and implement quality improvement '\", \"b'policy and guidelines related to both providers behavior and facility quality standards. '\", \"b'Objective 3: Improved individual and institutional capacity of subnational health systems to '\", \"b'provide quality services to address emerging national program priorities. '\", \"b'In addition to addressing cross-cutting quality improvement challenges in the public and private '\", \"b'sectors, this activity will also deliver technical assistance to national vertical programs (including '\", \"b'infectious diseases, reproductive, and maternal health) to strengthen vertical disease service '\", \"b'delivery at public health facilities, including hospitals and health centers, and private health '\", \"b'facilities and pharmacies. The interventions will apply updated global, regional and national '\", \"b'guidelines using integrated approaches. The Activity may also support the introduction of '\", \"b'innovative approaches that can be jointly defined by the national programs and other '\", \"b'stakeholders in healthcare systems.  '\", \"b'While almost all deliveries and most postnatal visits are attended by skilled birth attendants, the '\", \"b'quality of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) services should be improved to accelerate the '\", \"b'reduction of maternal and newborn mortality. The proposed interventions should address the '\", \"b'challenges in Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) so that complications during '\", \"b'and after delivery can be prevented. The proposed interventions should include innovative '\", \"b'approaches to build capacity of the health care provider to manage the emergency obstetric and '\", \"b'newborn care, which include on-site clinical coaching and mentoring.   '\", \"b'Further, modern contraceptive use continues to increase steadily at the rate of one percent per '\", \"b'year, however the unmet need is still very high and use of traditional methods among married '\", \"b'couples poses risks for unwanted pregnancy. Accessibility and availability of long-term methods '\", \"b'at health facilities is still challenging, especially in remote areas where the skill of midwives is '\", \"b'limited. The proposed interventions can include building the capacity of those providers to '\", \"b'provide high-quality family planning services. '\", \"b'  BUREAU/MISSION/PROJECT '\", \"b'4    '\", \"b'USAID 216 IEE TEMPLATE VERSION 1, DECEMBER 2017 '\", \"b'This activity will address infectious disease challenges in Cambodia through leading '\", \"b'improvements in the quality of health services and operational and policy frameworks that guide '\", \"b'infectious disease programs. The proposed interventions will contribute to an increase in '\", \"b'national TB case detection, and quality of diagnosis and treatment by identifying missing TB '\", \"b'cases at facility levels using systematic screening and improve health facility staff capacity to '\", \"b'diagnose and treat TB. These activities should focus on strengthening TB systems and service '\", \"b'delivery, particularly at the health center level.

'\", \"b'5. Background and Context '\", \"b'Humanitarian needs in the DRC are enormous. The DRC ranks 179 out of 191 countries on the Human '\", \"b'Development Index, and an estimated 72 percent of the population lives in poverty. According to the '\", \"b'most recent Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) Chronic Food Insecurity analysis, Kasai Province is at '\", \"b'level 4 (severe chronic food insecurity); while Kasai Central and Tanganyika are at level 3 (food '\", \"b'insecurity). Furthermore, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) (2018) indicates stunting '\", \"b'levels among children under five in Kasai is 47.4 percent, Kasai Central is 53.7 percent, and Tanganyika is '\", \"b'18.7 percent. The MICS data also indicate that among children 0-5 months only 30.1 percent in Kasai, '\", \"b'47.6 percent in Kasai Central, and 55.3 percent in Tanganyika are exclusively breastfed. Additionally, the '\", \"b'MICS data show that only 11.2 percent of households in Kasai, 8.5 percent of households in Kasai '\", \"b'Central, and 40.9 percent of households in Tanganyika access basic water services within 30 minutes of '\", \"b'their home. Finally, only 6.2 percent of households in Kasai, 10.4 percent of households in Kasai Central, '\", \"b'and 19.2 percent of households in Tanganyika have access to improved sanitation facilities.  '\", \"b'FNES in the DRC are driven by a combination of factors including, but not limited to: conflict, insecurity, '\", \"b'pests, economic shocks, epidemics, climate events, poor infrastructure, individual and family shocks, a '\", \"b'lack of agricultural development, insufficient external investment, and the exploitation of natural '\", \"b'resources. The situation in the DRC continues to be dynamic and unpredictable, with multiple shocks '\", \"b'and hazards further exacerbating chronic needs. Shocks and stressors are pervasive\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94whether related to '\", \"b'health, economics, natural hazards, increased climate variability, environment, or conflict. The DRC '\", \"b'scores low on indicators related to health risk exposure, political violence, adaptive capacity to climate '\", \"b'change, and civil conflict. Additionally, people suffer from high rates of food and nutrition insecurity, '\", \"b'720BHA23RFA00001                                                                                                                                                 Page 6 of 95 '\", \"b'extreme poverty, and displacement. Chronic conflict and neglect have stripped many communities of '\", \"b'their security, livelihoods, and social safety nets, leaving them ill-equipped to cope and recover from '\", \"b'shocks. '\", \"b'According to the IPC Acute Food Insecurity analysis, the DRC is the largest food security emergency in '\", \"b'the world with an estimated 26.4 million people experiencing acute food insecurity. While conflict and '\", \"b'population displacement are key drivers, chronic and extreme levels of poverty, lack of economic '\", \"b'opportunity, and weak agricultural production are responsible for much of these staggering numbers. '\", \"b'Some factors that contribute to low agricultural production in Kasai, Kasai Central, and Tanganyika '\", \"b'include:  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f A lack of good agricultural practices and extension services. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f A lack of access to farming inputs including tools; improved seeds, cuttings, and seedlings; crop '\", \"b'protection products; and fertilizer. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Poor soil quality (especially in Kasai and Kasai Central where soil is often sandy and acidic). '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Cultural norms impacting gender roles and responsibilities in agriculture. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Livestock diseases such as Virulent New Castle Disease or Peste des petits ruminants/Plague of '\", \"b'Small Ruminants. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f A lack of appropriate equipment and practices for fish farming, drying, and storage.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Crop diseases such as Cassava Brown Streak and insect and pest attacks such as Fall Armyworm.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Negative effects of climate change such as periods of drought, flooding, or erratic rainfall.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Poor natural resource management such as deforestation. '\", \"b'The DRC context is characterized by weak provision of state water, sanitation, health, and nutrition '\", \"b'services. Given the gap in state services, rural populations either rely on external development and '\", \"b'humanitarian actors and traditional healers, or use alternate coping strategies such as collecting poor '\", \"b'quality drinking water from streams and rivers. Additionally, access to safe, diverse, and nutrient-rich '\", \"b'food (NRF) is a clear problem, especially for poor and extremely poor Congolese who have limited '\", \"b'purchasing power. Diet quality is a challenge that extends beyond insufficient knowledge of which foods '\", \"b'are best to improve diets of women, girls, and children under two.  '\", \"b'While the provinces selected for the RFSA, Kasai, Kasai Central, and Tanganyika, are generally more '\", \"b'stable, prior violence and conflict in these areas have caused repeated displacement, decreased '\", \"b'livelihood opportunities, limited government services, hindered infrastructure development, damaged '\", \"b'natural resources, and increased disease outbreaks. Additionally, climate projections indicate the DRC is '\", \"b'likely to experience increases in temperatures, incidences of droughts and floods (potentially leading to '\", \"b'landslides and erosion), and precipitation variability. Agriculture1 within these provinces is highly '\", \"b'dependent on rainfall and current climate variability already negatively impacts crop, livestock, and '\", \"b'fishery productivity, potentially contributing to worsening food insecurity.  '\", \"b'In Tanganyika province, interethnic conflict between the Twa and Bantu ethnic groups continues to be a '\", \"b'destabilizing and destructive reality. This conflict has led to significant population displacement and food '\", \"b'insecurity. While Kasai and Kasai Central provinces have largely stabilized since the Kamuina Nsapu '\", \"b'conflict that occurred between 2016-2018, there are still pockets of intercommunal conflict that persist, '\", \"b'and the threat of a resurgence of conflict is ever present.

Kasai and Kasai Central have experienced drought, erratic rainfall, and livestock diseases. '\", \"b'The lack of thriving, profitable on-farm, off-farm, and non-farm enterprises and IGAs, have led to chronic '\", \"b'and pervasive poverty in Kasai, Kasai Central, and Tanganyika. This lack of economic opportunity means '\", \"b'that households do not have enough cash to cover household expenses such as food, clothing, '\", \"b'education, health care, improved sanitation, and access to clean water. Additionally, economic '\", \"b'participation for Congolese women is low.

'\", \"b'Poor road and bridge infrastructure leaves rural communities isolated from urban markets, impacting '\", \"b'agricultural producers and those with other enterprises and IGAs. Producer organizations and individual '\", \"b'farmers, fishers, and livestock producers often lack the linkages needed to access inputs, extensions '\", \"b'services, and buyers. Enterprises and farmers lack improved storage infrastructure and post-harvest '\", \"b'handling practices, which leads to a significant amount of post-harvest losses. Additionally, agricultural '\", \"b'enterprises are often challenged by a lack of business knowledge and poor management. '\", \"b'Financial services that could enable small business creation, expansion, or consistency of cash flow are '\", \"b'largely unavailable to rural populations within the target provinces. The inability of rural populations to '\", \"b'access and use credit or capital stifles the start up and growth of small businesses and IGAs and hinders '\", \"b'the ability of smallholder farmers to increase agricultural and livestock production.

People-centered approaches also '\", \"b'require: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Understanding the broader systems affecting communities (such as social dynamics and formal '\", \"b'and informal institutions) '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Addressing challenges (such as conflict, gender inequalities, shocks, and stressors) that may '\", \"b'undermine opportunities for positive change '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Providing linkages to newly emerging or previously out-of-reach resources, services, and '\", \"b'catalysts for change '\", \"b'Important factors to consider include: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Unique community power dynamics '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Existing community tensions related to natural resource management '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Different livelihoods, gender, age, social class, physical capabilities, and political or religious '\", \"b'affiliation  '\", \"b'b) Prioritization and Focus '\", \"b'BHA strongly discourages approaches that have too many wide-ranging interventions. Applicants are '\", \"b'therefore expected to analyze the context of the specific territories and health zones of operation, and '\", \"b'prioritize capacities and needs in order to develop programs specific to that context and the targeted '\", \"b'populations. In low resource environments, the full sweep of context-specific needs and opportunities '\", \"b'can easily exceed the capacity of any one activity to respond comprehensively and effectively. There are '\", \"b'limits, in addition, to the level of change in knowledge, attitudes, and practices that individuals, '\", \"b'households, and communities can absorb. Effective programming will identify leverage points and '\", \"b'factors that address key drivers of need and seek to prioritize and sequence a limited number of '\", \"b'interventions. Applicants must complete analysis and prioritization of factors for each system and '\", \"b'objective. Prioritization and focus on a limited number of factors affecting each purpose or objective of '\", 'b\"an applicant\\'s RFSA is key. Lessons learned from previous RFSA evaluations have indicated that projects \"', \"b'often try to respond to all determinants of food insecurity and malnutrition. The results have limited '\", \"b'success. Some interventions are successful, while others are not implemented at all or are only '\", \"b'successful at a very small scale due to a lack of prioritization and focus.  '\", \"b'c) Strive for Sustainability '\", \"b'In its goal statement, BHA has increased its commitment to investing in improved FNES for vulnerable '\", \"b'populations in a manner that supports long-term and self-perpetuating change and the continued well-'\", \"b'being of the vulnerable populations. Embodied in this commitment is the need to understand the '\", \"b'operating environment, including existing or residual conflict dynamics. Additionally, strengthened '\", \"b'formal and informal local systems increase the potential for sustained motivation, capacity, resources, '\", \"b'and linkages.  '\", \"b'd) Develop Context-Specific and Tailored Responses '\", \"b'A thorough analysis of the drivers of food, nutrition, and economic insecurity for each sub-target '\", \"b'population and thoughtful, direct, and inclusive engagement of communities in the design can facilitate '\", \"b'a more tailored approach to programming specific to each sub-target population. The analysis should '\", \"b'incorporate ways in which barriers to FNES relate to and influence each other and their impact on each '\", \"b'sub-target population. Carefully designed and implemented interventions tailored to the specific set of '\", \"b'720BHA23RFA00001                                                                                                                                                 Page 17 of 95 '\", \"b'participants provide greater potential for short-term impact and long-term sustainability than a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cone-'\", \"b'size-fits-all\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d approach. Understanding and responding to the local context and specific needs of different '\", \"b'groups, while also striving to promote social cohesion, can facilitate opportunities for transformative '\", \"b'change and help communities to grow, strengthen systems, and improve well-being for the most '\", \"b'vulnerable. BHA anticipates activities will strategically and operationally work in line with relevant '\", \"b'national and local government policies and systems to create opportunities for positive change by '\", \"b'leveraging and linking with other actors and programs working to address the drivers of food, nutrition, '\", \"b'and economic insecurity. This requires coordination and joint planning with a broad set of stakeholders '\", \"b'to support complementarity and coherence; collective impacts and sustainability; and the intentional '\", \"b'pursuit of sequencing, layering, and integrating (SLI) activities and interventions, including across the '\", \"b'humanitarian-development-peace (HDP) nexus. BHA expects applicants to have a thorough contextual '\", \"b'understanding of how a proposed RFSA would fit within the nexus context, including an understanding '\", \"b'of the opportunities and pitfalls. For example, in addition to describing how the proposed RFSA would, if '\", \"b'applicable, build off of humanitarian activities, BHA expects applicants to explain how they will avoid '\", \"b'duplication with actors such as the World Food Program (WFP), particularly around distribution of Title II '\", \"b'commodities.  '\", \"b'e) Community and Public- and Private-Sector Engagement and Sustainability '\", \"b'Applicants are strongly encouraged to incorporate local capacity strengthening in all areas of the '\", \"b'proposed activity. Local capacity engagement includes the amount of resources managed by local '\", \"b'entities, formal engagements (sub-awards, sub-contracts, partnerships, etc.), and capacity building '\", \"b'efforts with local civil society and the private sector, such as NGOs, cooperatives, universities, academia, '\", \"b'and private companies, among other entities. Applicants are also encouraged to consult with provincial '\", \"b'and local officials (including technical offices) to leverage their expertise and knowledge. Acceptable '\", \"b'local capacity engagement can be a combination of any of these approaches. Integration of local '\", \"b'capacity engagement must be context appropriate, reflected at every phase of the activity, and '\", \"b'expected to increase over the course of the award. As applicable and appropriate, BHA encourages '\", \"b'applicants to partner with local organizations and have local organizations directly manage resources to '\", \"b'the extent they have the necessary technical and financial management capacity. More information on '\", \"b'community and public- and private-sector engagement and sustainability can be found on page 34. '\", \"b'f) Anticipate and Manage Shocks and Stressors to Support Impact and Sustainability '\", \"b'BHA works in countries that are particularly vulnerable to rapid and slow onset disasters and complex '\", \"b'emergencies. As such, applicants should plan for and anticipate context-specific shocks and stressors. '\", \"b'This includes the ability to pivot and/or mitigate the negative effects of shocks through response '\", \"b'planning at the activity level and strengthening of relevant resilience capacities within the local system '\", \"b'and relevant local partners. When disaster risk exposure and vulnerabilities are reduced (e.g., when a '\", \"b'community is able to anticipate, prepare for, and reduce future risks of recurring natural hazards), '\", \"b'opportunities for a more resilient recovery increase. BHA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s disaster risk reduction (DRR) activities seek '\", \"b'to improve household, community, and national capacity to reduce risk, including from climate, and '\", \"b'strengthen disaster preparedness and management across all three types of resilience capacities (i.e., '\", \"b'absorptive, adaptive, transformative). It is important that applicants consider interventions that '\", \"b'strengthen people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s capacity to anticipate, prepare for, and reduce risks, and recover rapidly from '\", \"b'potential shocks by addressing the underlying causes of those disasters. Applicants should consider '\", \"b'approaches that integrate flexibility and adaptability to respond quickly to the impact of shocks.  '\", \"b'Applications may include, but are not limited to: '\", \"b'720BHA23RFA00001                                                                                                                                                 Page 18 of 95 '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Identifying underlying risks. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Reducing the impact of both current and future shocks, preventing the erosion of household '\", \"b'assets and livelihoods, and accelerating recovery\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94contributing to the future resilience of '\", \"b'affected households and communities.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Preparing for and rapidly responding to the impact of shocks and stressors. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Developing policies, strategies, and plans to minimize risks and explain how the specific '\", \"b'interventions will strengthen absorptive, adaptive, and transformative capacities. '\", \"b'g) Address Social Dynamics and Local Governance to Strengthen Local Systems '\", \"b'FNES are multi-dimensional challenges requiring a thorough understanding of contributing factors, '\", \"b'potential drivers, and existing bottlenecks down to the sub-population level. Social and gender norms, '\", \"b'power dynamics, levels of inclusion, and the nature of participation within local systems have the '\", \"b'potential to undermine development impacts when left unaddressed, or conversely, to provide engines '\", \"b'of positive change when enhanced in ways that increase motivation, equity, social cohesion, and '\", \"b'transparent, socially accountable service delivery. BHA supports awardees to work within local systems '\", \"b'in order to strengthen human and institutional actors through understanding, addressing, and improving '\", \"b'social dynamics and local governance. '\", \"b'h) COVID-19 Principles '\", \"b'Applicants are expected to nuance existing requirements to reflect COVID-19 considerations and factors, '\", \"b'ensuring that program approaches remain safe and accessible and do not amplify existing risks, or '\", \"b'create new ones. RFSA programs can play an important role in minimizing the impact of the pandemic;  '\", \"b'protecting nutrition security gains; and considering new risks facing households, communities, service '\", \"b'delivery, and local systems. However, the beneficial impact of interventions must be balanced with the '\", \"b'safety, health, and wellbeing of partner staff, and of those populations being served. For more '\", \"b'information, please refer to Guidance For BHA Development Food Security Activity Partners Working In '\", \"b'COVID-19 Affected Operating Environments. '\", \"b'i) Conflict-Sensitive Programming '\", \"b'Conflict-sensitive programming recognizes that all development and resilience programs are impacted '\", \"b'by conflict dynamics, whether positively or negatively, intentionally or unintentionally. Considering the '\", \"b'context in Kasai, Kasai Central, and Tanganyika, applicants should incorporate conflict-sensitive '\", \"b'approaches and considerations to minimize unintended negative outcomes and increase intentional '\", \"b'positive ones, while remaining focused on the RFSA goals and objectives. Applicants should describe '\", \"b'how targeting and interventions will be designed using a conflict-sensitive approach that protects social '\", \"b'cohesion and mitigates conflict at the community level. '\", \"b'j) Psychosocial Considerations '\", \"b'USAID expects applicants to recognize that psychosocial wellbeing has an impact on FNES. While USAID '\", \"b'does not expect separate psychosocial support interventions, applicants should develop their programs '\", \"b'while considering that there are high rates of trauma, anxiety, and depression among participants. '\", \"b'While the war in Kasai and Kasai Central ended in 2018 and Tanganyika is experiencing greater stability, '\", \"b'720BHA23RFA00001                                                                                                                                                 Page 19 of 95 '\", \"b'exposure to conflict-related traumatic events are a major mental health risk factor. Additionally, these '\", \"b'mental health concerns are exacerbated by high rates of sexual violence against women and girls.7  '\", \"b'8. Authorizing Legislation '\", \"b'The FFP Act, Section 201 (7 U.S.C. 1721) General Authority, authorizes the USAID Administrator to '\", \"b'establish programs to:  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Provide agricultural commodities to foreign countries on behalf of the people of the United '\", \"b'States to address famine and food crises.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Combat malnutrition, especially in children and mothers.

BHA anticipates '\", \"b'activities will strategically and operationally work in line with relevant national and local government '\", \"b'policies and systems; leverage and link with other actors working to address the drivers of food and '\", \"b'nutrition insecurity; and create opportunities for positive change. This requires coordination and joint '\", \"b'planning with a broad set of stakeholders to ensure activity complementarity, impact, and sustainability '\", \"b'and a focused understanding of the potential impact of SLI activities and interventions with other actors.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Sequencing is the intentional organization of phased program interventions to maximize '\", \"b'program impact.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Layering is the strategic coordination of overlapping interventions across stakeholders, sectors, '\", \"b'funding streams, and humanitarian and development programs. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Integrating is the intentional layering and sequencing of multi-sectoral interventions. Strategic '\", \"b'integration can address both emergency needs and longer-term development issues at the same '\", \"b'time in places where shocks are frequently recurring. It counters the assumption that '\", \"b'emergency and development activities take place on a chronological continuum. '\", \"b'SLI represents different synergistic programmatic approaches used in order to maximize the impact and '\", \"b'sustainability of the proposed interventions.

The Grand Challenge for Development Model '\", \"b'The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Government of Sweden, and '\", \"b'Duke Energy Corporation (collectively, the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFounding Partners\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d) have joined together to launch and fund '\", \"b'this Call for Proposals (CFP) for Powering Agriculture: An Energy Grand Challenge for '\", \"b'Development (PAEGC). The objective of PAEGC is to support new and sustainable approaches to '\", \"b'accelerate the development and deployment of clean energy solutions for increasing agriculture '\", \"b'productivity and/or value in developing countries. '\", \"b'The Grand Challenge for Development model is designed to focus global attention on specific, narrowly '\", \"b'defined international development problems, and to facilitate solving them.3 Grand Challenges encourage '\", \"b'solutions that build on physical and social science research and technological advancements, and engage '\", \"b'new actors that might otherwise not receive support through traditional international development '\", \"b'programs. Importantly, the model supports solutions with the potential to achieve scale in low resource '\", \"b'settings by, among other things, leveraging commercial investment and financing.    '\", \"b'2. Background and Problem Statement '\", \"b'PAEGC catalyzes resources and focuses attention on the problem that many farmers and agribusinesses in '\", \"b'developing countries lack access to reliable and clean energy services. As such, they are less able to adopt '\", \"b'modern agricultural techniques, increase food production, engage in opportunities for value-added '\", \"b'processing, and benefit from broad-based, environmentally-sound economic growth. '\", \"b'Historically, efforts to bolster the agriculture and energy sectors have been largely stove-piped, reflecting '\", \"b'little regard for the interdependency between the two sectors. However, as the global population steadily '\", \"b'3 PAEGC is the third in a series of Grand Challenges for Development that USAID initiated with international partners.  The previous '\", \"b'two Grand Challenges respectively focus on maternal and newborn health and early-age literacy: (i) \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSaving Lives at Birth,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and (ii) '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll Children Reading.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  Further information about these initiatives can be found online at: www.savinglivesatbirth.net and '\", \"b'www.allchildrenreading.org.  '\", \"b'Page 9 of 32 '\", \"b'BAA for Powering Agriculture  '\", \"b'An Energy Grand Challenge for Development Competition  '\", \"b'RFA-OAA-12-000027  '\", \"b'SOL-OAA-13-000017 '\", \"b'increases, substantial intensification of agricultural production will need to occur. Within each stage of '\", \"b'agriculture supply chains \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 input production or supply (i.e. seed, fertilizer, feed, etc.), irrigation, '\", \"b'production (i.e. planting crops, raising livestock), storage, transport, processing (i.e. sorting, drying, '\", \"b'grinding, packaging), wholesaling, marketing, retailing, and waste management \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 there are opportunities '\", \"b'for increased integration of clean energy services to support this endeavor. '\", \"b'Globally, most pathways to agricultural intensification have required significant use of fossil fuels. Such '\", \"b'approaches result in a destabilizing linkage between food and oil prices - as the price of oil fluctuates in '\", \"b'global markets, so do costs associated with producing food. Without reliable access to clean energy '\", \"b'services, the global growth in energy demand within developing countries\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 agricultural sector will result '\", \"b'in increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, further contributing to the problem of climate change. '\", \"b'Despite global support and associated economic and environmental imperatives, there remain significant '\", \"b'barriers that hinder the use of clean energy within developing countries\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 agriculture sector, including:  '\", \"b'\\\\xef\\\\x82\\\\xb7 '\", \"b'Limited Demand: In many locations, farmers and agribusinesses are not aware of clean energy '\", \"b'technologies that might increase the productivity/profitability of their operations. Awareness is a '\", \"b'necessary but insufficient condition for demand.  Additional elements are understandably required to '\", \"b'switch from long-standing agriculture practices.  '\", \"b'\\\\xef\\\\x82\\\\xb7 '\", \"b'Inappropriate Technology Design: Often, available technology does not match the performance '\", \"b'characteristics and/or price points required in emerging markets.   '\", \"b'\\\\xef\\\\x82\\\\xb7 '\", \"b'Limited Access to Financing: The problems of risk and design are compounded by lack of credit to '\", \"b'distributors of clean energy products and services who then in turn cannot provide or direct '\", \"b'customers to end user financing.   Banks and other financial institutions, already skeptical about '\", \"b'lending to farmers and agribusinesses, are unfamiliar with clean energy products and services that '\", \"b'frequently have relatively high initial capital costs.   '\", \"b'\\\\xef\\\\x82\\\\xb7 '\", \"b'Few Replicable Business Models: Few examples exist of proven business models that can be '\", \"b'replicated and/or adapted to link clean energy enterprises with farm communities and agribusinesses '\", \"b'in relevant supply chains.  There are even fewer examples of profitable clean energy service '\", \"b'companies in rural areas with resource constrained customers. '\", \"b'As a result of these barriers, there is a noticeable disconnect between clean energy enterprises and the '\", \"b'farmer and the agribusiness consumers. Strengthening the demand for and supply of clean energy is '\", \"b'critical to improved productivity and/or value of agriculture.   '\", \"b'3. Areas of Technical Interest for PAEGC Proposals '\", \"b'The Grand Challenge for Development model reflects an understanding that there is seldom just one way '\", \"b'to solve complex development problems. In this regard, this CFP is designed to attract a diverse range of '\", \"b'market-driven approaches to accelerate the design and deployment of clean energy solutions for farmers '\", \"b'and agribusinesses. '\", \"b'The specific clean energy needs of farmers and related agribusinesses vary widely among different '\", \"b'geographic regions. Countries differ significantly with respect to their natural resources, existing '\", \"b'infrastructure, trade relations, energy policies, income levels, and maturity of clean energy markets.

'\", \"b'Adaptation refers to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe process of adjusting to the actual or expected climate and its effects in '\", \"b'order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (USAID Climate Strategy).

'\", \"b'In ADS 303.6 USAID defines a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clocal entity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as an individual, a corporation, a nonprofit '\", \"b'organization, or another body of persons that: (1) Is legally organized under the laws of; and (2) '\", \"b'Has as its principal place of business or operations in; and (3) Is majority owned by individuals '\", \"b'who are citizens or lawful permanent residents of; and (4) Is managed by a governing body the '\", \"b'majority of who are citizens or lawful permanent residents of the country receiving assistance.  '\", \"b'For purposes of this section, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98majority owned\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98managed by\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 include, without limitation, '\", \"b'beneficiary interests and the power, either directly or indirectly, whether exercised or '\", 'b\"exercisable, to control the election, appointment, or tenure of the organization\\'s managers or a \"', 'b\"majority of the organization\\'s governing body by any means. \"', \"b'Coordination and Leverage '\", \"b'USAID, host country governments, other donors, and the private sector have made, and continue '\", \"b'to make, significant investments in climate adaptation globally.

This will not only '\", \"b'avoid a duplication of effort, but also ensure that interventions are building synergies with on-'\", \"b'going work, augmenting level of effort, scaling up proven solutions, and reducing burden on '\", \"b'overlapping beneficiaries or local coordinators. USAID encourages applicants to use innovative '\", \"b'approaches that are able to leverage available private sector resources, especially with local '\", \"b'private sector entities including micro, small, and medium businesses.  If private sector resources '\", \"b'are leveraged, applicants should ensure that arrangements are equitable and do not result in any '\", \"b'unintended adverse outcomes.      '\", \"b'Equitable and Inclusive Climate Action '\", \"b'Applicants should center their approaches on equitable and inclusive climate actions.  These are '\", \"b'actions that meaningfully engage diverse stakeholders, particularly those that are marginalized '\", \"b'and/or been historically underrepresented in decision-making processes, to address the root '\", \"b'causes of climate risks, develop holistic programs that directly meet the needs of communities, '\", \"b'and fairly distribute benefits and adverse impacts.

'\", \"b'(3)   Any requests for an exemption from USAID marking requirements, and an '\", \"b'explanation of why the exemption would apply. The applicant may request an exemption '\", \"b'if USAID marking requirements would: '\", \"b'(i)   Compromise the intrinsic independence or neutrality of a program or '\", \"b'materials where independence or neutrality is an inherent aspect of the program '\", \"b'and materials. The applicant must identify the USAID Development Objective, '\", \"b'Interim Result, or program goal furthered by an appearance of neutrality, or state '\", \"b'why an aspect of the award is presumptively neutral.

'\", \"b'3. Safety and Security Plan '\", \"b'Among BHA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s primary programming concerns is that its implementing partners take all '\", \"b'reasonable precautions to minimize risks to all staff and operations funded by BHA. While no '\", \"b'one can eliminate risk, BHA expects your organization to be adequately prepared to work in any '\", \"b'environment for which you submit an application. You must incorporate operational security '\", \"b'management systems, appropriate to your organization and operational area(s), into all activities. '\", \"b'BHA requires you and your sub-awardees to submit location-specific Safety and Security Plans '\", \"b'for proposed operational areas under this NOFO. If a sub-awardee is unable to submit a plan of '\", \"b'their own, your organization must explicitly cover the sub-awardee staff and operations in your '\", \"b'Safety and Security Plan. Appropriate geographic units for contextual, threat, and vulnerability '\", \"b'analyses may be as specific as a village, town, city, or neighborhood where activity interventions '\", \"b'will occur. Submission of global security handbooks or policy documents does not satisfy BHA '\", \"b'requirements for Safety and Security Plans. You must demonstrably write Safety and Security '\", \"b'Plans that apply directly to the areas where you propose interventions. You must cover all '\", \"b'personnel and operations funded under your BHA activity, including sub-awardees or other '\", \"b'partners with substantive programmatic contributions, with a Safety and Security Plan. '\", \"b'All Safety and Security Plans must include and clearly address the following for each location '\", \"b'where you propose activities: '\", \"b'35 '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Contextual analysis; '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Threat analysis; '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Vulnerability analysis; '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Contingency planning for relevant emergency situations such as '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8b Abductions or illegal detention; '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8b Evacuation; '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8b Emergency medical care; '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8b Psycho-social support for staff impacted by serious crimes or personal violence; '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8b Sexual assault; '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8b Armed attack; '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8b Reporting and prosecution options; and '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Risk mitigation measures in relation to the above topics, which must address specific '\", \"b'needs based on analysis of proposed activity areas. '\", \"b'Definitions of these technical terms can be found in the Overseas Development Institute '\", \"b'Humanitarian Practice Network\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Good Practice Review 8, Operational Security Management in '\", \"b'Violent Environments, December 2010.

Vetting is conducted independently from any '\", \"b'discussions the AO may have with an applicant. The applicant and any proposed subrecipient(s) '\", \"b'or contractor(s) subject to vetting must not provide vetting information to anyone other than the '\", \"b'Vetting Official.

'\", \"b'1. Background '\", \"b'For more than 60 years, USAID has supported Brazil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s development agenda.  In 2014 '\", \"b'USAID/Brazil became a Strategic Partnership Mission focused on catalyzing a Brazilian '\", \"b'Amazon economy that fosters empowered, sustainable communities and conserves '\", \"b'biodiversity, forests and natural resources. USAID works closely with the Brazilian '\", 'b\"government and civil society to ensure the integrity of the Amazon\\'s biodiversity and improve \"', \"b'local livelihoods through a combination of approaches: strengthening protected area '\", \"b'management, reinforcing sustainable value chains, and promoting innovative private sector '\", \"b'engagement as a means to sustainable economic development (see USAID/Brazil '\", \"b'Environmental Partnerships). '\", \"b'USAID/Brazil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s development program is the Partnership for the Conservation of Amazon '\", \"b'Biodiversity (PCAB). PCAB\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s purpose is to ensure the integrity and conservation of the '\", \"b'Brazilian Amazon ecosystem over the next 20 years, improving the well-being and '\", \"b'socioeconomic status of rural communities based on sustainable economic activities in the '\", \"b'Amazon. PCAB\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s development hypothesis is that if USAID strengthens protected area '\", \"b'management and sustainable livelihoods, with an emphasis on advancing new tools, '\", \"b'technologies, and partnerships, then biodiversity will be conserved and community well-'\", \"b'being will improve. Additionally, if USAID facilitates and shapes demand-side solutions '\", \"b'through stimulating private-sector investment and leadership, then systemic, scaled '\", 'b\"economic development pathways for Brazil\\'s Amazon will be compatible with, and supportive \"', \"b'of biodiversity conservation.  '\", \"b'The PCAB program is funded through a Congressional earmark focused on biodiversity '\", \"b'conservation in the Brazilian Amazon and represents USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s core strategy in Brazil.

'\", \"b'Background:  '\", \"b'19 '\", \"b'NOFO/APS No. 72051222APS00001 '\", \"b'Partnership to Conserve Amazon Biodiversity (PCAB) '\", \"b'The Brazilian Legal Amazon is a unique patchwork of biological and cultural '\", \"b'ecosystems, containing 10 percent of the world\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s biodiversity. Yet, this abundance has '\", \"b'not translated into socioeconomic development for the region: its 28 million people '\", \"b'make up nearly 15 percent of Brazil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s population but share only nine percent of its gross '\", \"b'domestic product (GDP). A shift in economic incentives would allow the region to tap '\", \"b'into its underutilized bioeconomy potential, while raising the level of human '\", \"b'development, conserving its biodiversity and responding to the climate crisis.  '\", \"b'Harnessing the potential of an economy based on standing forests presents many '\", \"b'opportunities and challenges, including accelerating forest restoration and reforestation, '\", \"b'removing deforestation and increasing sustainability and resilience of key supply chains, '\", \"b'and unlocking finance to harness the forests\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 potential while keeping it standing.  '\", 'b\"Overcoming these challenges is key to improving local communities\\' livelihoods, as well \"', \"b'as businesses, by reducing the risks related to supply chains and attracting '\", \"b'investments.   '\", \"b'Developing new and expanding existing financial mechanisms to incentivize the '\", \"b'development of an economy based on standing forest is likely to be critical to deliver '\", \"b'biodiversity and climate change goals.  Additionally, such goals are unlikely to be '\", \"b'achieved without closely engaging private sector actors to reduce the risks of harmful '\", \"b'impacts of unsustainable commodity production and extractive practices on ecosystem '\", \"b'conditions and local communities.  '\", \"b'In response, USAID is interested in fostering innovative partnerships with the private '\", \"b'sector, civil society, and historically marginalized groups, including women, youth, and '\", \"b'Indigenous communities, in order to improve natural resource management and forest '\", \"b'management practices.

'\", \"b'Through the Climate Smart and Disaster Ready APS, BHA will implement innovative and '\", \"b'applicable adaptation solutions in communities at greatest risk to climate-related disasters in '\", \"b'current and foreseeable humanitarian settings.  This APS focuses on local, inclusive climate '\", \"b'solutions and partnerships. It will work across communities to reduce the risk of climate-related '\", \"b'disasters and improve communities\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 resilience to climate change. '\", \"b'USAID/BHA works with countries at risk of natural hazards including climate impacts to reduce '\", \"b'risk of potential disasters. This includes assistance for disaster preparedness, disaster risk '\", \"b'reduction (DRR) and climate adaptation activities to lessen adverse impacts of and contingency '\", \"b'planning for, natural disasters including climate related disaster abroad. Climate risk reduction '\", \"b'for adaptation identifies the risks present in a country or region; the vulnerability of people, '\", \"b'livelihoods, and infrastructure; and the resources available for relief, rehabilitation, and risk '\", \"b'reduction efforts. DRR for climate related disasters measures implement activities to reduce loss '\", \"b'of life, livelihoods, and property by reducing vulnerability and exposure of people while '\", \"b'increasing their capacity. Recognizing the benefits in lives and resources saved, USAID/BHA '\", \"b'provides assistance to reduce risks to vulnerable people and property posed by natural and '\", \"b'human-caused hazards. '\", \"b'Background '\", \"b'Exposure to extreme weather and climate, combined with low coping capacity, degraded natural '\", \"b'resources, settlements in marginal lands, and weak governments, can lead to loss of lives, '\", \"b'destruction of livelihoods and homes, food insecurity, and adverse impacts on people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health '\", \"b'and socioeconomic well-being.  Climate change affects intensity, location, duration, and timing '\", \"b'of climate hazards, leading to an increase in disasters and food insecurity, further eroding '\", \"b'governments\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and communities\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 capacity to cope, and often resulting in displacement and '\", \"b'migration which can fuel conflict and social unrest.  Globally, climate related disasters claimed '\", \"b'over 500,000 lives affecting about 4 billion people, and cost over $2 trillion during 2000-20191. '\", \"b'Climate change affects us all, but not equally. About 95 percent of people killed by disasters are '\", \"b'from developing countries, and women, children, and the elderly suffer the greatest disaster '\", \"b'losses.  Historically, planning and development have tended to exclude marginalized '\", \"b'communities, relegating them to areas where they are more exposed to environmental and '\", \"b'climate hazards. The effects of climate-related disasters are magnified when they are recurrent, '\", \"b'1 The Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, Human Cost of Disasters (2000-2019),  '\", \"b'https://cred.be/sites/default/files/CredCrunch61-Humancost.pdf '\", \"b'6 '\", \"b'preventing a population from fully recovering or reconstituting resources to cope with cascading '\", \"b'or compounding events.

BHA will invest in multi-year interventions to achieve the goal of reducing climate risk '\", \"b'and support communities and countries to adapt to climate change.   '\", \"b'Program Objectives '\", \"b'BHA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s overall vision for climate adaptation is to catalyze transformative changes in '\", \"b'humanitarian assistance to advance climate adaptation and reduce disaster risks.  The goal of the '\", \"b'Climate Smart and Disaster Ready APS is to implement innovative and applicable adaptation '\", \"b'solutions in communities at greatest risk to climate related disasters, in current and foreseeable '\", \"b'humanitarian settings. The Climate Smart and Disaster Ready APS objectives are to: 1) invest in '\", \"b'locally-led solutions through enhanced local partnerships; 2) amplify climate thought leadership '\", \"b'and the knowledge base with innovative solutions from change agents serving communities at '\", \"b'greatest risk; and 3) scale up proven climate-risk reduction actions for enhanced adaptation of '\", \"b'communities with greatest vulnerability.   '\", \"b'Adaptation refers to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe process of adjusting to the actual or expected climate and its effects in '\", \"b'order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (USAID Climate Strategy).  In '\", \"b'simple terms, countries and communities need to develop adaptation solutions and implement '\", \"b'actions to respond to the impacts of climate change that are already happening, as well as prepare '\", \"b'for future impacts.  Adaptation solutions take many forms, depending on the unique context of a '\", \"b'community, business, organization, country, or region. There is no \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98one-size-fits-all-solution\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94'\", \"b'adaptation can range from natural and nature-based flood management, setting up early warning '\", \"b'systems for cyclones, community-based risk reduction actions and switching to climate resilient '\", \"b'crops, to, integrating climate into disaster response and risk reduction strategies, plans and '\", \"b'policies. Many nations and communities are already taking steps to build resilient societies and '\", \"b'economies, but considerably greater action and ambition will be needed to cost-effectively '\", \"b'manage the risks, both now and in the future. '\", \"b'To tackle a problem as large as climate change, we need science and indigenous knowledge.

This evaluation will be by a USAID/BHA '\", \"b'Selection Committee (SC) for responsiveness to all the criteria outlined here in the umbrella APS '\", \"b'and in each specific Round.  Competition under APS Rounds will consist of a two-step process '\", \"b'where applicants first submit a concept paper for an initial competitive review. '\", \"b'After a concept paper is received, USAID/BHA reserves the right to pose clarifying questions '\", \"b'and conduct discussions with any applicant but may opt not to do so if it believes it has sufficient '\", \"b'information in the concept paper itself.

USAID/BHA understands that the '\", \"b'information in a concept paper will be preliminary and may change in the full application (if '\", \"b'requested). '\", \"b'Concept papers are not evaluated against other concept papers, but rather against the concept '\", \"b'paper review criteria in each specific Round. The evaluation/review of the content in the concept '\", \"b'papers against each specific Round will allow USAID/BHA to determine if an organization '\", \"b'could propose a potentially successful and responsive technical approach in a full application. '\", \"b'Due to the number of concept papers received, USAID/BHA is not able to provide details on '\", \"b'why concept papers were not selected/passed.

'\", \"b'Method 3 - De minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) '\", \"b'Eligibility: Any applicant that does not have a current NICRA '\", \"b'Initial Application Requirements: Costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or '\", \"b'direct costs but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. If chosen, this '\", \"b'methodology once elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as '\", \"b'a non-Federal entity chooses to negotiate an indirect rate, which the non-Federal entity may '\", \"b'apply to do at any time.  The applicant must describe which cost elements it charges '\", \"b'indirectly vs. directly.  See 2 CFR 200 for further information. '\", \"b'Method 4 - Indirect Costs Charged As A Fixed Amount '\", \"b'Eligibility: Non U.S. non-profit organizations without a NICRA may request, but approval is '\", \"b'at the discretion of the AO  '\", \"b'Initial Application Requirements: Provide the proposed fixed amount and a worksheet that '\", \"b'includes the following: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Total costs incurred by the organization for the previous fiscal year and estimates for the '\", \"b'current year.  Guidance to AO: If the indirect costs are expected to be minimal or easily '\", \"b'attributed to performance of a USAID agreement, the AO should delete this first bullet.     '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Indirect costs (common costs that benefit the day-to-day operations of the organization, '\", \"b'including categories such as salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel '\", \"b'administration, and accounting, or that benefit and are identifiable to more than one '\", \"b'program or activity, such as depreciation, rental costs, operations and maintenance of '\", \"b'facilities, and telephone expenses) for the previous fiscal year and estimates for the '\", \"b'current year '\", \"b'28 '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Proposed method for prorating the indirect costs equitably and consistently across all '\", \"b'programs and activities of using a base that measures the benefits of that particular cost to '\", \"b'each program or activity to which the cost applies. '\", \"b'If the applicant does not have an approved NICRA and does not elect to utilize the 10% de '\", \"b'minimis rate, the Agreement Officer will provide further instructions and may request additional '\", \"b'supporting information, including financial statements and audits, should the application still be '\", \"b'under consideration after the merit review.  USAID is under no obligation to approve the '\", \"b'applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s requested method.  '\", \"b'e. Prior Approvals in accordance with 2 CFR 200.407 '\", \"b'Inclusion of an item of cost in the detailed application budget does not satisfy any requirements '\", \"b'for prior approval by the Agency.  If the applicant would like the award to reflect approval of '\", \"b'any cost elements for which prior written approval is specifically required for allowability, the '\", \"b'applicant must specify and justify that cost.

'\", \"b'DIV funds four types of grants. Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 grants follow a tiered approach that '\", \"b'aligns the funding amount to the strength of the evidence of impact, cost-effectiveness, and '\", \"b'scalability of the proposed innovation. Evidence Generation grants are reserved for rigorous '\", \"b'evaluations of already scaled or scaling development solutions that lack sufficient rigorous '\", \"b'evidence of impact and cost-effectiveness.

This working '\", \"b'paper finds that DIV\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s early portfolio returned over $17 in social benefit for each dollar '\", \"b'awarded. '\", \"b'Core principles of DIV '\", \"b'The following are core principles of DIV: (1) evidence of impact on improving lives of people '\", \"b'living in poverty in the developing world, (2) cost-effectiveness, and (3) viable potential for '\", \"b'scale and financial sustainability. DIV provides tiered funding based on an innovation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'demonstrated track record of and potential for achieving each of these principles. Below, DIV '\", \"b'provides background on each of these core principles before outlining the requirements for each '\", \"b'stage in subsequent sections. '\", \"b'1. Evidence of Impact '\", \"b'Evidence of impact demonstrates what does and does not work to deliver positive '\", \"b'development outcomes for people living in poverty. DIV supports the piloting of early-'\", \"b'stage innovations, funds research to test new and traditional solutions to development '\", \"b'challenges and helps those innovations that have successfully demonstrated impact to '\", \"b'transition to scale. DIV looks for different indicators of impact and requires different '\", \"b'degrees of rigor in evaluation methodologies depending on the stage of financing that the '\", \"b'5 '\", \"b'applicant is seeking and, on the innovation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, proposed pathway to scale. All applicants '\", \"b'must demonstrate a clear theory of change that draws upon available evidence. The more '\", \"b'evidence an applicant presents in support of their innovation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s theory of change and '\", \"b'impact on development outcomes, the stronger the application. '\", \"b'Public Pathway to Scale: To support later-stage innovations to transition to scale '\", \"b'with public financing, including by government or philanthropic funding, DIV '\", \"b'requires applicants to show rigorous evidence of causal impact on improving the '\", \"b'lives of people living in poverty. DIV does not require applicants for earlier-stage '\", \"b'awards for piloting and testing of innovations to show rigorous evidence of causal '\", \"b'impact and will issue awards for earlier-stage innovations to help innovations get '\", \"b'to the point at which they have this rigorous evidence of impact. Measurement of '\", \"b'impact can encompass either final outcomes or impacts that can be taken as '\", \"b'worthwhile objectives per se (e.g., reducing infant mortality). Measurement of '\", \"b'impact can also encompass improvements to intermediate outcomes on the causal '\", \"b'chain for solutions that have been previously demonstrated to have a causal '\", \"b'impact on final outcomes (e.g., increasing vaccination rates, which have an '\", \"b'existing evidence base of causal impact on improved health). '\", \"b'Commercial Pathway to Scale: To support later-stage innovations to transition '\", \"b'to scale commercially, DIV requires applicants to show evidence of long-run '\", \"b'market viability. DIV typically accepts customer willingness to pay the full costs '\", \"b'of the innovation as such evidence. DIV does not require applicants for earlier-'\", \"b'stage awards for piloting and testing to show such evidence and will issue awards '\", \"b'for earlier-stage innovations to get to the point where they have this evidence. For '\", \"b'example, an applicant may use a Stage 1 award to gather evidence on consumer '\", \"b'reaction to and willingness to pay for the product. As an applicant progresses to '\", \"b'higher stages of financing, DIV expects the applicant to demonstrate an '\", \"b'increasingly compelling case for long-run market viability. In addition, DIV '\", \"b'requires applicants at all stages to show stage-appropriate data on usage, or in '\", \"b'some situations on proxies for social outcomes that track how the innovation is '\", \"b'improving the lives of people living in poverty. '\", \"b'2. Cost-Effectiveness '\", \"b'DIV seeks innovations that deliver more development impact per dollar than other '\", \"b'solutions or the status quo. Cost-effectiveness is a function of both cost and impact and '\", \"b'does not mean that an innovation is the cheapest solution. Instead, an innovation can '\", \"b'increase its cost-effectiveness either by reducing its cost or by increasing its impact. DIV '\", \"b'recognizes that costs of an innovation at scale may be different than costs generated '\", \"b'through earlier testing phases, so applicants should provide data around current and '\", \"b'projected costs.  '\", \"b'3. Potential for Scale and Financial Sustainability '\", \"b'6 '\", \"b'DIV\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s goal is to support impactful development solutions that will scale to reach and '\", \"b'improve millions of people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lives within 10 years. Accordingly, innovations must have a '\", \"b'potential pathway to scale in the long run through commercial funding, public-sector or '\", \"b'philanthropic funding, or a hybrid of the two. DIV defines a hybrid pathway to scale as a '\", \"b'pathway that is reliant on a combination of public and commercial revenue channels or '\", \"b'that is supported by a combination of commercial along with public or philanthropically '\", \"b'motivated funding (e.g., an education technology innovation that is partially funded '\", \"b'through direct-to-consumer sales and partially funded by donors). DIV recognizes that '\", \"b'innovations can take a variety of pathways to scale but expects that they will be '\", \"b'financially sustainable over a period of time that is necessary to achieve development '\", \"b'impact and ultimately grow without continued DIV support. In some places below, the '\", \"b'criteria outline separate, additional requirements for innovations based on their proposed '\", \"b'pathways to scale. To the extent that applicants propose a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chybrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d pathway to scale, they '\", \"b'must demonstrate how they meet each relevant criterion.2 '\", \"b'Stages of financing '\", \"b'DIV funds four types of grants, and applicants must meet the criteria for the relevant grant type, '\", \"b'as detailed below. The first three types\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94align the funding '\", \"b'amount to the strength of the evidence of impact, cost-effectiveness, and potential for scale and '\", \"b'financial sustainability of the proposed innovation. DIV supports only those innovations that are '\", \"b'at the post-prototype stage (i.e., the critical aspects of how the innovation works have already '\", \"b'been tested). Applicants should apply for the stage that best reflects the current level of maturity '\", \"b'of their innovation and do not need to enter at Stage 1. However, applicants must demonstrate in '\", \"b'their applications that they have met the conditions of the earlier stage(s) prior to applying for a '\", \"b'later-stage award. DIV reserves the right to consider innovations for funding at a different stage '\", \"b'or amount than the applicant has requested, which may be addressed during a co-creation process '\", \"b'after the application is submitted. '\", \"b'The fourth type of grant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Evidence Generation grants\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94is for rigorous evaluations of '\", \"b'development solutions that are scaling or that have already scaled and lack sufficient rigorous '\", \"b'evidence of impact and cost-effectiveness. '\", \"b'Given DIV\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s limited pool of resources, it assesses whether a grant for a particular activity '\", \"b'provides social returns that are competitive with likely returns from grants to other applicants. '\", \"b'Accordingly, the more funding that an applicant requests\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94even within a funding tier\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94the '\", \"b'higher DIV\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s expectations for development impact, cost-effectiveness, and ability to scale. '\", \"b'To meet DIV\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s requirements, many successful applicants form coalitions of partners with diverse '\", \"b'2 For example, if an energy innovation that reduces pollution costs $10 per unit, and the applicant proposes to scale '\", \"b'the innovation through customer payments of $7.50 and public support of $2.50, the applicant must show that '\", \"b'customer payments would cover $7.50 and must also show rigorous evidence of causal impact of at least $2.50 of '\", \"b'social impact of reduced pollution costs. Applications for earlier-stage awards would not need rigorous evidence of '\", \"b'causal impact but should help build towards the point at which such evidence would be available. '\", \"b'7 '\", \"b'skills and may also use or seek additional funding from other sources. Applications are stronger '\", \"b'if they leverage non-DIV support and, all else equal, the more support that is leveraged, the '\", \"b'stronger the application is. Additional support can take different forms depending on the nature '\", \"b'of the innovation (e.g., a commitment from a developing country government to implement the '\", \"b'innovation, a financial commitment from an external investor, in kind support, etc.). '\", \"b'DIV aims to be catalytic with its funding, which means that grantees should be able to achieve '\", \"b'results after receiving a DIV grant that they would not have been able to achieve without that '\", \"b'grant. Applicants should state explicitly why they are coming to DIV now and how a grant will '\", \"b'catalyze their innovation. '\", \"b'STAGE 1: Pilot \\\\xe2\\\\x89\\\\xa4 $200,000 '\", \"b'Purpose: DIV funds Stage 1 awards to support the piloting of innovations in a developing '\", \"b'country. Innovations at this stage are early in their development and require pilot testing to refine '\", \"b'the basic model and establish real-world viability at a small scale. DIV supports only those '\", \"b'innovations that are post-prototype and ready to be field-tested at the time of application (i.e., '\", \"b'innovations that are still undergoing development in a lab or that are still at the idea stage are '\", \"b'premature for DIV\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s support). '\", \"b'Examples of activities that Stage 1 awards may support include the following: assessment of '\", \"b'demand and willingness to pay for the innovation, exploration of different delivery models, '\", \"b'conducting user testing on a prototype, documenting social outcomes and real-world costs to '\", \"b'implement the solution, etc. '\", \"b'Application Requirements: To be eligible to receive a Stage 1 award, applicants must '\", \"b'demonstrate the following criteria for each of DIV\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s three core principles: '\", \"b'1. Evidence of Impact '\", \"b'All applicants must make a credible case of the potential benefit to individuals living in '\", \"b'poverty. Rigorous evidence of causal impact is not required at this stage; however, '\", \"b'applicants must present a strong theory of change and justify how and why the innovation '\", \"b'is likely to generate a positive development impact. Applicants should articulate plans to '\", \"b'collect data during the award period that would test key assumptions in the theory of '\", \"b'change. While not required, applications for innovations with some existing piloting or '\", \"b'that have a theory of change that is backed by rigorous evidence of causal impact are '\", \"b'stronger. For innovations that have not already undergone piloting, applicants must '\", \"b'explain the questions that the piloting is designed to answer and how they intend to find '\", \"b'the answers to those questions. Additional requirements for demonstrating evidence of '\", \"b'impact depend on the innovation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s proposed pathway to scale, as follows: '\", \"b'8 '\", \"b'Public Pathway to Scale: Applicants should include plans to iterate the '\", \"b'innovation so that it will be ready for rigorous testing of causal impact and cost-'\", \"b'effectiveness following the end of the award period. '\", \"b'Commercial Pathway to Scale: Applicants should include plans to assess '\", \"b'potential customers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 demand and willingness to pay or to conduct initial market '\", \"b'testing. Applicants do not need to show revenue or paying customers at this stage. '\", \"b'Hybrid Pathway to Scale: Applicants should include plans to assess potential '\", \"b'customers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 demand and willingness to pay or to conduct initial market testing. '\", \"b'Applicants do not need to show revenue or paying customers at this stage. To the '\", \"b'extent that applicants will rely on public funding as a significant portion of their '\", \"b'revenue, they should also include plans to iterate the innovation so that it will be '\", \"b'ready for rigorous testing of causal impact and cost-effectiveness following the '\", \"b'end of the award period. '\", \"b'2. Cost-Effectiveness '\", \"b'Applicants should articulate why their innovation has the potential to be cost-effective at '\", \"b'scale. This articulation should include a discussion of the likely costs and cost-'\", \"b'effectiveness of the innovation relative to alternative solutions including the status quo '\", \"b'and a projection of the major drivers of cost and cost-effectiveness of the innovation '\", \"b'when it is at scale. DIV recognizes that Stage 1 innovations may not have robust financial '\", \"b'forecasting data but wants to understand the applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s perspective on the potential for '\", \"b'cost-effectiveness should the evidence demonstrate impact. '\", \"b'3. Potential for Scale and Financial Sustainability '\", \"b'All applicants, regardless of their pathway to scale, must demonstrate that their '\", \"b'innovation has the potential to reach millions of lives sustainably. Applicants must '\", \"b'describe how they expect the innovation to be financially sustained at scale and should '\", \"b'make the case that there is potential for someone to pay for the innovation at scale. '\", \"b'Applicants should also identify the types of partners that would be critical to scale an '\", \"b'innovation and the types of partners that would pay for it (e.g., government, '\", \"b'manufacturers, other direct service organizations, etc.). If relevant, applicants should '\", \"b'describe the extent to which relationships with partners have already been built. '\", \"b'STAGE 2: Testing & Positioning for Scale \\\\xe2\\\\x89\\\\xa4 $1,500,000 '\", \"b'Purpose: DIV funds Stage 2 awards to support the further testing and expansion of innovations '\", \"b'beyond the piloting stage. Applicants for Stage 2 awards will have already conducted successful '\", \"b'9 '\", \"b'pilot testing and are now ready to rigorously test an innovation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s impact or market viability. '\", \"b'For innovations that are designed to scale publicly, successful applicants must either already '\", \"b'have rigorous evidence of causal impact or conduct a rigorous evaluation of causal impact during '\", \"b'the award. Applicants may also use award funds to simultaneously expand operations in ways '\", \"b'that would position the innovation to transition to scale, e.g., by testing alternative approaches to '\", \"b'implementation or by finding ways to satisfy requirements for scaling that are likely to be '\", \"b'imposed by long-run funders. '\", \"b'For innovations that are designed to scale commercially, awards may support the further testing '\", \"b'of innovations to provide evidence on whether they are market-viable and deliver positive '\", \"b'development outcomes for people living in poverty. For innovations designed to scale '\", \"b'commercially, successful applicants may use award funds to conduct further market testing, '\", \"b'market strategy development, expand operations, etc. '\", \"b'Application Requirements: To be eligible to receive a Stage 2 award, applicants must '\", \"b'demonstrate the following criteria for each of the three DIV core principles: '\", \"b'1. Evidence of Impact '\", \"b'Public Pathway to Scale: Applicants must either demonstrate that there is '\", \"b'existing rigorous evidence of the innovation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s causal impact on a development '\", \"b'outcome and cost-effectiveness or provide a plan that explains how the applicant '\", \"b'will demonstrate such evidence during the award period (e.g., through a '\", \"b'randomized controlled trial, etc.). Measurement must assess outcomes (e.g., lives '\", \"b'saved, additional income generated) or intermediate outcomes for which rigorous '\", \"b'evidence already exists (e.g., vaccinations are proven to improve health, and thus '\", \"b'the application could measure increases in vaccination rates). The impact '\", \"b'evaluation must have adequate statistical power and must include a credible '\", \"b'counterfactual of what would have happened in the absence of the innovation. '\", \"b'The evaluation should be designed to reasonably infer whether the innovation '\", \"b'would be cost-effective at scale relative to alternative solutions. '\", \"b'Commercial Pathway to Scale: Applicants must demonstrate the following: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f '\", \"b'A clear theory of change that draws upon existing evidence (though '\", \"b'it need not be causal at this stage) that the innovation has the '\", \"b'intended impact on development outcomes and plans to collect data '\", \"b'on usage or, in some situations, on proxies for social outcomes. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f '\", \"b'A compelling case of market viability. An applicant can make a '\", \"b'compelling case of market viability by showing that the innovation '\", \"b'has the potential to generate enough revenues to fully cover costs '\", \"b'(including customer acquisition costs, distribution costs, '\", \"b'10 '\", \"b'headquarters costs, capital costs, depreciation, etc.), together with a '\", \"b'plan to test whether the innovation can indeed cover such costs. '\", \"b'An applicant could also make a compelling case of market viability '\", \"b'by showing that it can reasonably expect to attract commercial '\", \"b'capital on market terms by the end of the Stage 2 award, since an '\", \"b'investor would invest only if it believed that revenue would '\", \"b'eventually be sufficient to cover fully loaded costs.3 For products '\", \"b'that are viable on purely commercial terms without an element of '\", \"b'government or philanthropically motivated funding and that are sold '\", \"b'primarily to people living in poverty, DIV does not require rigorous '\", \"b'evidence of causal impact.4 '\", \"b'An applicant could also make a compelling case of market viability '\", \"b'by showing that it can reasonably expect to attract capital on '\", \"b'concessional terms awarded due to the social impact of the '\", \"b'innovation. DIV will consider such hybrid scaling strategies, but to '\", \"b'the extent that the scaling path relies on philanthropically motivated '\", \"b'funding such as impact investment or funding associated with '\", \"b'corporate social responsibility, applicants will typically need during '\", \"b'the award to demonstrate rigorous evidence of causal impact and '\", \"b'show that the philanthropically motivated portion of funding is a '\", \"b'cost-effective way to achieve the development objective.5 '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f '\", \"b'A compelling case that the applicant will be able to show by the end '\", \"b'of a Stage 2 award that the innovation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s benefits exceed its costs, '\", \"b'especially focusing on benefits and costs to those living in poverty.6 '\", \"b'3 Note that the applicant need not actually apply for and take commercial capital on market terms. Rather, the '\", \"b'applicant need show only that it is able to attract such capital to make a compelling case of market viability.'\", \"b'4 For example, if people living in poverty are purchasing solar systems at a price that covers the systems\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fully '\", \"b'loaded cost, DIV would presume that the benefits exceed the costs and would not require rigorous evidence of '\", \"b'causal impact, for example, on whether children are learning more in school because they could study at night. On '\", \"b'the other hand, for innovations that are not sold directly to people living in poverty, applicants should propose an '\", \"b'appropriate way to collect data that demonstrates benefits to people living in poverty, e.g., if the innovation is a '\", \"b'system designed to reduce injuries in factories, and the purchasers are garment factories, the applicant should '\", \"b'produce rigorous evidence of a causal impact on injury rates.'\", \"b'5 An exception to the heightened evidentiary requirements for the philanthropic portion would be if the '\", \"b'philanthropic portion were minimal, if the innovation had clear benefits to people other than paying customers, and '\", \"b'if a rigorous test of causal impact and cost-effectiveness were unfeasible.'\", \"b'6 For most innovations, evidence of market viability can also serve as evidence that the innovation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s benefits exceed '\", \"b'the costs since customers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 willingness to pay a price that fully covers costs is evidence that they place at least that '\", \"b'much value on the product. One exception to this notion would be innovations that might generate net negative '\", \"b'consequences for others, e.g., pollution. Another exception would be innovations that consumers might pay for '\", \"b'despite the innovation not being beneficial for them, e.g., products sold based on misleading claims or addictive '\", \"b'products. A third exception would be a product that is viable in the market due only to subsidies. For example, if an '\", \"b'innovative energy source were more expensive than alternatives and viable only because of regulations that force '\", \"b'11 '\", \"b'2. Cost-Effectiveness '\", \"b'Applicants must demonstrate plans to analyze cost-effectiveness or show that they have '\", \"b'already done so. Applicants should discuss the costs and cost-effectiveness of alternative '\", \"b'solutions and should also discuss the major cost drivers and cost-effectiveness of the '\", \"b'innovation at scale. '\", \"b'For innovations designed to scale publicly, applicants should provide data on likely '\", \"b'current and future costs of the innovation; impact per dollar spent compared to '\", \"b'alternatives; and information on how costs and cost-effectiveness will be measured. For '\", \"b'innovations designed to scale commercially, applicants should be able to provide relevant '\", \"b'commercial data, including a financial analysis of the innovation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s potential to '\", \"b'commercialize, analysis of market demand, and all relevant costs. '\", \"b'3. Potential for Scale and Financial Sustainability '\", \"b'Applicants must demonstrate that the innovation has the potential to impact millions of '\", \"b'lives. Applicants must discuss the financial resources they expect to be required to scale '\", \"b'the innovation over time and their vision for how such resources will be obtained. '\", \"b'Proposals will be stronger if applicants have established relationships with the partners '\", \"b'envisioned for scaling (e.g., partnerships with distributors; orders from large customers; '\", \"b'Memoranda of Understanding with the government indicating commitment to scale '\", \"b'should evidence demonstrate a positive impact, etc.). '\", \"b'STAGE 3: Transitioning to Scale \\\\xe2\\\\x89\\\\xa4 $15,000,000 '\", \"b'Purpose: DIV funds Stage 3 awards to transition proven approaches from piloting and testing to '\", \"b'widespread scaling in new contexts or new geographies. Applicants should have completed the '\", \"b'activities for Stage 2 innovations, with or without prior DIV support.7 Specifically, applicants '\", \"b'should have already demonstrated either rigorous evidence of causal impact and a convincing '\", \"b'case based on this impact measurement that the intervention would be cost-effective at scale (for '\", \"b'public scaling) or market viability (for commercial scaling) at the time of their Stage 3 '\", \"b'application. Successful Stage 3 applicants must collect data on costs and social outcomes during '\", \"b'the award and may use award funds to adapt the innovation to new contexts, to prepare the '\", \"b'innovation for scaling, to conduct further testing of the extent to which the evidence of an '\", \"b'innovation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s impact is applicable in new geographies or settings, and to kickstart the scaling '\", \"b'process. '\", \"b'firms to buy it, the innovation would be classified as a hybrid, and DIV would require the applicant to show that the '\", \"b'benefits of the public subsidy exceed the cost.'\", \"b'7 In general, Stage 3 applications are stronger if they leverage non-DIV support and, all else equal, the more support '\", \"b'that is leveraged, the stronger the application is. Support can take different forms depending on the nature of the '\", \"b'innovation. For example, it could consist of a commitment from a developing country government to implement the '\", \"b'innovation in its original or adapted form, or it could consist of a financial commitment from an external investor. '\", \"b'12 '\", \"b'Most Stage 3 grants will be under $5 million. Occasionally, DIV may consider a Stage 3 grant of '\", \"b'up to $15 million, but DIV would review such applications with even greater rigor. For '\", \"b'innovations designed to scale commercially, DIV is reluctant to crowd out commercial investors, '\", \"b'and we target Stage 3 funding for adapting, improving, or expanding successful approaches to '\", \"b'new markets. '\", \"b'Application Requirements: Applicants should identify and address operational challenges for '\", \"b'scaling and should plan for activities that allow for refinement and iteration along defined '\", \"b'pathways to scale. In addition, applicants are required to demonstrate the following criteria: '\", \"b'Public Pathway to Scale: Applicants for Stage 3 awards for innovations designed to '\", \"b'scale publicly must demonstrate rigorous evidence of causal impact on a development '\", \"b'objective and a compelling case based on the impact measurement that the solution will '\", \"b'be cost-effective at scale relative to alternative solutions. Evidence of impact and a '\", \"b'compelling case for cost-effectiveness (e.g., through a randomized controlled trial, '\", \"b'regression discontinuity, etc.) of the innovation must already exist prior to application. '\", \"b'Applications will be stronger if the applicant can produce evidence of commitment from '\", \"b'the developing country government and other entities that will be involved in scaling. '\", \"b'Commercial Pathway to Scale: Stage 3 innovations intended to scale commercially '\", \"b'should already have demonstrated market viability as described more fully above in Stage '\", \"b'2\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEvidence of Impact\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d descriptions of market viability. Applicants should therefore no '\", \"b'longer need donor funding for regular operations; instead, they would use donor funds '\", \"b'only to adapt and scale to new contexts. To enable maximum leverage of DIV funds, DIV '\", \"b'will endeavor to allow commercial investors the opportunity to fund these innovations. In '\", \"b'addition, applicants must demonstrate a convincing case using evidence and data for how '\", \"b'and why these additional investments in adapting and scaling the innovation in new '\", \"b'contexts will yield a high return for the poor. The additional DIV funding for adaptation '\", \"b'should unlock significant additional capital or generate greater scale that allows the '\", \"b'applicant to increase their social impact. '\", \"b'EVIDENCE GENERATION '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x89\\\\xa4 $1,500,000 '\", \"b'DIV is committed to generating evidence on the causal impact of widely implemented '\", \"b'development approaches. DIV accepts applications for Evidence Generation grants to evaluate '\", \"b'development approaches that are widely used but do not have sufficient evidence from rigorous '\", \"b'evaluations of causal impact and cost-effectiveness, even if those development approaches are '\", \"b'not innovative. Evidence Generation grants fit within the larger DIV mission because, if an '\", \"b'approach that is evaluated under an Evidence Generation grant is found to be ineffective, then '\", \"b'development implementers could innovate by not using the approach or by trying a modified '\", \"b'version of the approach. Alternatively, if the approach is found to be effective, implementers can '\", \"b'scale it further and optimize resource allocation to support interventions with proven impact. '\", \"b'13 '\", \"b'Applicants for Evidence Generation grants are invited to apply on their own or in partnership '\", \"b'with an implementer (e.g., a host country government, social enterprise, nonprofit, etc.). If an '\", \"b'applicant is applying for an award for a rigorous test of causal impact for a development '\", \"b'approach that is not yet widely implemented and thus could be considered innovative, then the '\", \"b'applicant should apply for a Stage 2 grant.

'\", \"b'Time Frame: Five years '\", \"b'Resource Requirements: Estimated $20 million '\", \"b'II. Statement of Purpose '\", \"b'The purpose of this five year, estimated $20 million Feed the Future Guatemala Connecting '\", \"b'Value Chains in the Verapaces activity is to sustainably reduce food insecurity, malnutrition, and '\", \"b'4 '\", \"b'irregular migration in Alta and Baja Verapaz. This activity will increase the prosperity and '\", \"b'resilience of rural communities by investing in activities that address the root causes of poverty '\", \"b'and increase farmer livelihoods and resilience, especially for smallholder communities and '\", \"b'including Indigenous Peoples, women, and youth. To accomplish this goal, USAID will work '\", \"b'across four strategic components: '\", \"b'1. improve agricultural productivity and crop diversity.  '\", \"b'2. expand smallholder crop market access. '\", \"b'3. strengthen resilience to shocks and stressors; and '\", \"b'4. improve nutritional outcomes. '\", \"b'The Feed the Future Guatemala Connecting Value Chains in the Verapaces activity contributes '\", \"b'to the following Mission Development Objectives: '\", \"b'1. Partner with the GOG and other stakeholders to increase economic prosperity, inclusion, '\", \"b'and stability in areas with high irregular migration '\", \"b'2. Partner with the GOG and other stakeholders to strengthen effective and accountable '\", \"b'governance to improve quality of life and reduce irregular migration '\", \"b'The successful achievement of these objectives shall result from innovative approaches in '\", \"b'collaboration with local organizations; private sector; civil society; Guatemalan local, regional '\", \"b'and national governments; and Indigenous communities to sustainably improve the livelihoods '\", \"b'of small-holder farmers. In addition, development assistance provided through this Activity will '\", \"b'support cross-cutting efforts to reduce irregular migration out of Guatemala to the United States. '\", \"b'This Program Description describes the objectives of the U.S. Agency for International '\", \"b'Development in Guatemala (USAID/G) for a new Feed the Future activity in lieu of a fully '\", \"b'developed U.S. Government (USG) written Program Description (PD) to provide the potential '\", \"b'applicant with the flexibility to develop cost effective solutions and the opportunity to propose '\", \"b'innovative approaches to meet the stated objectives. Consistent with the agency Localization '\", \"b'Strategy and the CDCS 2020-2025, this Activity aligns with strengthening local capacity and '\", \"b'ownership as competition is exclusive to consortiums led by local Guatemalan entities. '\", \"b'Additional priority will be given to consortiums that include at least one local organization from '\", \"b'Alta or Baja Verapaz (the Verapaces). US-based and other international organizations are '\", \"b'eligible members of the consortium if they have demonstrated experience working in the region. '\", \"b'This is a two-stage procurement process. Applicants will first be invited to submit a concept note '\", \"b'to present innovative ideas in a cost-effective way that meets the objectives of the activity.  '\", \"b'5 '\", \"b'USAID/Guatemala anticipates using a Fixed Amount Award (FAA) for the value of this activity '\", \"b'where payments will be made to the recipient based on milestones, the achievement of outcomes '\", \"b'and results. The milestones will be negotiated with the selected applicant prior to award.  '\", \"b'III. Background and Context '\", \"b'While Guatemala is considered an upper middle-income country with a per capita annual income '\", \"b'of $8,200 (2017 estimate), the unequal distribution of wealth is extreme: 260 Guatemalans '\", \"b'(0.001 percent of the population) own 56 percent of the national economy. Although the overall '\", \"b'economy has grown steadily, poverty has simultaneously increased by 10 percent (2011-2014) '\", \"b'over the same period with Alta Verapaz exhibiting the highest rate of poverty in the country at '\", \"b'78.8 percent. The Verapaces are also seeing increased levels of irregular migration to the United '\", \"b'States with rates from Baja Verapaz among the highest. A recent typology analysis for '\", \"b'Guatemala done by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) determined that the '\", \"b'majority of the Verapaces municipalities with high poverty and chronic malnutrition rates (50% '\", \"b'average in the Verapaces) also have significant agriculture potential, thereby providing USAID '\", \"b'an opportunity to expand Feed the Future activities to Alta and Baja Verapaz.  '\", \"b'USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) has been very active in the Verapaces for '\", \"b'many years. Most recently and following the effects of the 2020 hurricane season and COVID-'\", \"b'19 pandemic, USAID through BHA implementing partners has provided food, multipurpose '\", \"b'cash, shelter, and WASH assistance in Alta Verapaz. In response to worsening food insecurity, '\", \"b'USAID/BHA supports the delivery of cash assistance for food to meet emergency food needs '\", \"b'and prevent and address malnutrition among food-insecure households in Guatemala. '\", \"b'USAID/BHA food assistance aims to address increased needs in a manner that improves food '\", \"b'consumption patterns and increases dietary diversity. Additionally, USAID/BHA partners are '\", \"b'supporting the most vulnerable smallholder farmers and other agriculture-dependent households '\", \"b'to ensure appropriate and timely inputs for planting and growing seasons\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94such as farming tools, '\", \"b'fertilizer, and seeds as well as knowledge related to improved pest and soil management\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94to '\", \"b'improve food security. BHA also supports family poultry systems, which, coupled with a '\", \"b'community member veterinarian program (ParaVets), not only provides a healthy meat option '\", \"b'for families but also an additional source of income from their sale. A thriving community '\", \"b'savings and loan program, led primarily by women, provides seed financing for members to use '\", \"b'in income generating and household activities. With the Verapaces region newly incorporated '\", \"b'into Guatemala\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Global Food Security Strategy, USAID and its FTF initiative will extend '\", \"b'medium and long-term food security activities to emerging and existing smallholder commercial '\", 'b\"farmers. This activity will leverage BHA\\'s expertise in this region on interventions such as \"', \"b'biofortified crops, chicken production in the context of nutrition-sensitive agriculture and best '\", \"b'agriculture practices already implemented in the region. This activity should explore '\", \"b'6 '\", \"b'opportunities to support former BHA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s beneficiaries, especially those producers ready to become '\", \"b'part of a formal value chain.  '\", \"b'Previous and current USAID activities in this region have also supported environmental '\", \"b'outcomes. Deforestation and forest degradation are a major challenge for the Verapaces region, '\", \"b'particularly Alta Verapaz. Located in Guatemala\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eastern tropical and temperate highlands, '\", \"b'deforestation in Alta Verapaz began in the late 1950s when the government encouraged landless '\", \"b'peasants to migrate to the area by granting them land. Today, deforestation drivers include '\", \"b'fuelwood collection and conversion for small, medium, and large-scale agriculture, including '\", \"b'cash crops such as cardamom, allspice, turmeric and coffee. Baja Verapaz ranks among the '\", \"b'departments with the greatest forest cover loss, with a net annual rate of 1.45 percent between '\", \"b'2006-2010. Challenges in this region include frequent landslides, scarce employment '\", \"b'opportunities, a heavy reliance on recycled maize seeds, inefficiencies in product value chains '\", \"b'that lead to greater resource use and lower yields, limited farming of higher value products and '\", \"b'market linkages to increase income and employment generation. Over the years, USAID has '\", \"b'worked to reduce Guatemala\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s primary sources of land-based Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, '\", \"b'deforestation and forest degradation, through sustainable forest management, agroforestry '\", \"b'systems and sustainable soil management practices.  '\", \"b'The effects of Russia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s war against Ukraine have made prices for fertilizer, food, and fuel '\", \"b'increase on top of already high prices due to the impact of COVID-19. In Guatemala, '\", \"b'nationwide, fertilizer prices are greater than 100% higher than one year ago and prices in the '\", \"b'Verapaces are nearly 300% higher which may lead to decreased use of this important input and '\", \"b'could result in decreased productivity and incomes. At the same time, prices for maize, a staple '\", \"b'of the local diet, have increased by 80%. These stressors are particularly acute for subsistence '\", \"b'farmers, who must choose between using less fertilizer, or lower quality fertilizer, reducing '\", \"b'cropping area or not planting at all, further exacerbating the availability of staple grains. Erratic '\", \"b'weather patterns further stress the Verapaces as evidenced by the effects of 2021 Hurricanes '\", \"b'ETA and IOTA. The timing of the Feed the Future Connecting Value Chains in the Verapaces '\", \"b'activity is prescient to address the compounding effects of simultaneous shocks. '\", \"b'IV. Relationship to USAID Policies '\", \"b'This Activity supports the USAID/Guatemala Country Development and Cooperation Strategy '\", \"b'(CDCS) 2020-2025. The goal of USAID/Guatemala\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s CDCS is to advance Guatemala\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s self-'\", \"b'reliance by connecting indigenous peoples, women, and youth to opportunities that enable them '\", \"b'to achieve prosperous, secure, and dignified lives at home in Guatemala.

This Activity supports the objectives of the U.S. '\", \"b'Strategy for Addressing the Root Causes of Migration in Central America. This strategy aims to '\", \"b'achieve, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA democratic, prosperous, and safe Central America, where people advance '\", \"b'economically, live, work, and learn in safety and dignity, contribute to and benefit from the '\", \"b'democratic process, have confidence in public institutions, and enjoy opportunities to create '\", \"b'futures for themselves and their families at home.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d This Activity supports the first Pillar of the '\", \"b'Root Causes Strategy, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAddressing economic insecurity and inequality,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d through the '\", \"b'development of sustainable income and employment opportunities in the Verapaces. This work '\", \"b'will contribute to the strategy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s following lines of effort outlined in Pillar 1: 1) Foster a Business '\", \"b'Enabling Environment for Inclusive Economic Growth; 2) Increase and Diversify Trade; 3) '\", \"b'Enhance Workforce Development, Health, Education, and Protection; and 4) Build Resilience to '\", \"b'Address Climate Change and Food Insecurity. '\", \"b'Relationship to Feed the Future. Feed the Future is the US government\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s global hunger and '\", \"b'food security initiative to address the root causes of poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. In '\", \"b'Guatemala, Feed the Future programming has successfully worked with smallholder farmers and '\", \"b'their families in the Western Highlands to strengthen connections to markets, adopt improved '\", \"b'agricultural technologies, create new jobs, protect forests and critical watersheds, increase access '\", \"b'to services such as clean water, and improve the nutritional status of communities, especially '\", \"b'children under five. The Verapaces region share similar conditions to the Western Highlands: '\", \"b'high levels of poverty and malnutrition, fragmented high value export chains, geographic '\", \"b'isolation, lack of economic opportunities, poor access to basic services, increasing levels of '\", \"b'irregular migration, and low levels of private sector investment. Given the continued success of '\", \"b'Feed the Future programming in the Western Highlands, USAID plans to expand this work to '\", \"b'Alta and Baja Verapaz as it was established in the current strategy and following the Food '\", \"b'Security Strategy Results Framework for Guatemala. '\", \"b'8 '\", \"b'Relationship to USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S Multi Sectoral Nutrition Strategy 2014-2025.  Optimal nutrition is '\", \"b'fundamental to achieving USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wider mission to end extreme poverty and to promote '\", \"b'resilient, democratic societies while advancing our national security and prosperity. USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S '\", \"b'2014-2025 Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy is the first of its kind at USAID and Guatemala was '\", \"b'recently designed as a strategic alignment country within this strategy The Strategy is aligned '\", \"b'with the 2025 World Health Assembly Nutrition Targets and reaffirms both USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'commitment to global nutrition, and our role as a major international partner in the fight against '\", \"b'malnutrition. The Strategy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s multi-sectoral approach addresses both direct and underlying causes '\", \"b'of malnutrition, and its focus on linking humanitarian assistance with development programming '\", \"b'helps build resilience to shocks in vulnerable communities. '\", \"b'With this strategy, USAID aims to decrease chronic malnutrition, measured by stunting, by 20 '\", \"b'percent through the U.S. Government\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Feed the Future and Global Health initiatives, the Office '\", \"b'of Food for Peace development programs, resilience efforts, and other nutrition investments.  '\", \"b'9 '\", \"b'Globally, within Feed the Future targeted intervention areas, USAID will concentrate resources '\", \"b'and monitor impact to reduce the number of stunted children by a minimum of 2 million. In '\", \"b'humanitarian crises, USAID aims to mitigate increases in acute malnutrition with the goal of '\", \"b'maintaining Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) below the emergency threshold of 15 percent. In '\", \"b'2025, we see a world where countries, communities, and families have the capacity to achieve '\", \"b'and sustain healthy, well-nourished populations. The new Verapaces activity will incorporate '\", \"b'lessons learned from the nutrition sensitive approaches in the most recent Guatemala FtF value '\", \"b'chain activities and will follow the strategic framework provided under these Global strategies to '\", \"b'implement nutrition-sensitive agriculture interventions to contribute to the reduction of '\", \"b'malnutrition in the new Feed the Future Zone of Influence. '\", \"b'Relationship to the Agency\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Resilience Policy. This activity supports the objectives of '\", \"b'USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Resilience Policy, which aims to reduce chronic vulnerability and promote inclusive '\", \"b'growth in areas of recurrent crisis.  The activity supports efforts to build resilience and contribute '\", \"b'to the sustainable reduction of vulnerability and inclusive growth by 1) increasing the capacity of '\", \"b'smallholder farmers to adapt to the impacts of climate and other shocks and stressors, 2) '\", \"b'furthering farmer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s abilities to address and reduce risks and 3) improving the social and '\", \"b'economic conditions of vulnerable populations. The activity will include shock responsive '\", \"b'measures and will use the USAID: Tools and Approaches- Shock Responsive and Adaptive '\", \"b'Mechanisms guide to incorporate these into the design.  '\", \"b'Relationship to the Agency\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Climate Change Strategy. This activity supports the objectives '\", \"b'of USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Climate Strategy 2022-2030, whose goal is to advance equitable and ambitious '\", \"b'actions to confront the climate crisis. The activity supports the strategy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Strategic Objective 1 '\", \"b'through targeted direct climate adaptation actions in high priority communities and locations by '\", \"b'promoting climate resilient farming and value chain practices. The activity further supports the '\", \"b'strategy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s second Strategic Objective, which aims to transform food systems to be more resilient '\", \"b'and less environmentally destructive in an equitable and locally led manner.

By considering the ways that activity design and activities may '\", \"b'impact cultures, territories, resources, and/or livelihoods, the PRO-IP promotes thoughtful and '\", \"b'direct engagement of Indigenous Peoples in the design, implementation and monitoring of '\", \"b'activities to ensure the communities benefit, and that those benefits are in line with the '\", \"b'communities\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 self-determined development objectives. Further, USAID/Guatemala\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Indigenous '\", \"b'People\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Engagement Strategy guides partners to apply PRO-IP to the Guatemalan context by: 1) '\", \"b'Creating innovative and substantive partnerships between indigenous entities, government and '\", \"b'the private sector, including non-governmental organizations and other groups within civil '\", \"b'society; 2) Increasing awareness, knowledge and recognition of indigenous peoples\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rights, '\", \"b'culture, history, and knowledge systems; and 3) Increasing the participation of indigenous '\", \"b'women and men in development interventions through USAID, implementing partners and '\", \"b'others. This activity will be implemented in Alta and Baja Verapaz where the PRO-IP policy and '\", \"b'strategy will guide the consultations, work, and results achieved with Indigenous People in these '\", \"b'locations.  '\", \"b'HA/DA Coherence.  Humanitarian-Development-Peace (HDP) coherence aims to maximize '\", \"b'impact and sustainability across kinds of assistance while reducing humanitarian need. HDP '\", \"b'coherence is more important than ever as the number, magnitude and duration of crises and '\", \"b'conflicts are on the rise in Guatemala. Mutually reinforcing activities ensures that the significant '\", \"b'efforts and activities of collaborators are aligned towards achieving the common agenda and '\", \"b'11 '\", \"b'shared measures. Building on the successful practices and strategies implemented by BHA in the '\", \"b'region, as well as FtF programs in the country in addressing poverty, hunger, lack of inputs, and '\", \"b'access to credit will be an important strategy in this activity, helping the extremely poor move '\", \"b'from dependency to productive members of the local economy, ensuring graduation from '\", \"b'poverty into market systems. Applicants will be expected to propose practical examples for the '\", \"b'activity to consider how to build on these time-bound interventions. '\", \"b'V. Theory of Change '\", \"b'In line with USAID\\\\xc2\\\\xb4s Feed the Future Strategy for Guatemala, the Feed the Future Guatemala '\", \"b'Connecting Value Chains in the Verapaces activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s theory of change suggests that by focusing '\", \"b'its interventions on addressing the multifactorial causes of risk, while intentionally including '\", \"b'historically marginalized populations, empowering youth in agriculture to adopt improved '\", \"b'agricultural crops and technologies; women are provided with the same access to resources and '\", \"b'tools as men and have the desire to engage in rural livelihoods; and the private sector is '\", \"b'incentivized to co-invest resources where there is both a business and development impact. Then, '\", \"b'youth can be change agents in their communities, contribute to economic growth in the region, '\", \"b'and be less likely to migrate; woman will have increased ability to engage in economic activities '\", \"b'and achieve economic empowerment; the private sector will continue to operate and grow their '\", \"b'businesses in the Verapaces region serving as an employer and income generator, resulting in a '\", \"b'higher chance of sustained economic growth in the Verapaces region.  '\", \"b'VI. Objectives and Required Results '\", \"b'The primary purpose of this activity is to increase the prosperity and resilience of rural '\", \"b'communities in the Verapaces by providing market-based economic opportunities to improve the '\", \"b'livelihoods of smallholder farmers and their families and reduce irregular migration. To achieve '\", \"b'this, the activity will be rooted in four objectives: 1) improving smallholder productivity of new '\", \"b'existing crops; 2) expanding and strengthening market access; 3) strengthening climate resilience '\", \"b'to shocks and stressors; and 4) increasing adoption of nutrition and hygiene practices.    '\", \"b'This activity will be implemented primarily with Feed the Future funding. '\", \"b'Together with USAID, the implementer will establish targets for the following expected results:  '\", \"b'1. Income of farmers assisted under this activity increased through increased sales of '\", \"b'agricultural products '\", \"b'12 '\", \"b'2. Increased sales volumes from new and existing markets '\", \"b'3. Number of new jobs added '\", \"b'4. Increased access to financial services (credit, insurance, other products) for agri-business and '\", \"b'farmers  '\", \"b'5. Increased investment in agricultural technologies by farmers assisted under this activity '\", \"b'6. Number of hectares under improved management practices or technologies that promote '\", \"b'improved climate risk reduction and/or natural resources management increased '\", \"b'7. Number of women participating in FTF-funded agricultural activities increased '\", \"b'8. Number of women and children under five years consuming a diet of minimum diversity '\", \"b'increased '\", \"b'9. Number of people supported to adapt to the effects of climate change '\", \"b'10. Amount of private sector and/or donor funds leveraged in support of the activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s goals '\", \"b'The implementer will report on indicators that respond directly to the Feed the Future Initiative '\", \"b'as requested by the Bureau for Resilience and Food Security (RFS) as well as those that respond '\", \"b'to the Root Causes Strategy and the Agency\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Climate Strategy. The applicant will be '\", \"b'responsible for the achievement of the results listed in the introduction to section V. The '\", \"b'applicant will determine how the results will be met and, in addition to those listed in Section V, '\", \"b'shall propose specific activities for each of the four components. '\", \"b'Objective 1: Improved productive and diverse value chains '\", \"b'The majority of Guatemala\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s exports are agriculturally based, and approximately 80 percent of '\", \"b'all jobs in the country are generated by small and medium enterprises (SME) in the sector. This '\", \"b'Activity will therefore focus on strengthening agricultural value chains and the production of '\", \"b'value-added products which are the primary economic activities of rural populations in the '\", \"b'Verapaces. The region has promising agricultural potential which provides the Feed the Future '\", \"b'initiative opportunities to support new crops and partners. In addition to traditional crops like '\", \"b'coffee and cardamom, the Verapaces also produce spices, turmeric, pepper, allspice, cacao, and '\", \"b'select horticulture crops. This new activity will contribute to Mission priorities in reducing '\", \"b'irregular migration by creating income generating activities, especially targeting youth, '\", \"b'indigenous communities, and women. To achieve the results described above, applicants should '\", \"b'demonstrate an understanding of existing and promising crops in each department when '\", \"b'proposing activities.  '\", \"b'Adoption of improved technologies and practices. Smallholder agriculture is characterized by '\", \"b'limited landholdings with farmers growing the same crop for many years. In addition, farmers in '\", \"b'the Verapaces are geographically isolated and this can limit their access to the products, services, '\", \"b'and technical support needed to adopt new approaches that can improve agricultural productivity '\", \"b'13 '\", \"b'and farmer livelihoods while also reducing environmental harm. Illustrative examples could '\", \"b'include improved seed and plant varieties; irrigation; improved post-harvest management '\", \"b'including drying and other value-added practices; soil health enhancements; early warning and '\", \"b'climate information to support farmers digital solutions; technologies that promote the use of '\", \"b'renewable energy, among others. Applicants should explain their approach to technology and '\", \"b'practice adoption including how farmers will access new tools using cardamom, coffee, and one '\", \"b'other crop as examples. Additionally, the concurrent shocks as a result of the COVID-19 '\", \"b'pandemic and Russia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s invasion of Ukraine have led to high fertilizer costs. Applicants should '\", \"b'address how they will mitigate high costs of this input to maintain or improve crop performance.  '\", \"b'Crop diversification. The majority of smallholder farmers in the Verapaces cultivate one crop. '\", \"b'Should this crop suffer from erratic weather, price fluctuations, or a new pest or disease, farmer '\", \"b'income decreases, and farmers are left with limited economic generating activities. To improve '\", \"b'resilience to shocks and stressors, through this activity, USAID will promote crop diversification '\", \"b'to expand farmer sources of income. Applicants should recommend their approach for '\", \"b'introducing new crops including new crop selection, supporting farmers in adopting the new '\", \"b'crop, and how the farmers will be integrated into new markets. Please provide examples of two '\", \"b'existing crops in the region and the new crops that could be considered. '\", \"b'Objective 2: Expanded smallholder crop market access '\", \"b'Because the majority of Guatemala\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s exports are agriculturally based, and approximately 80 '\", \"b'percent of all jobs in the country are generated by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), USAID '\", \"b'has prioritized strengthening Guatemalan value chains and SME growth. To execute USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'Private Sector Engagement Policy, USAID will foster enterprise-led development, by creating '\", \"b'jobs, economic opportunities with agribusinesses, and helping SMEs overcome constraints such '\", \"b'as lack of capital and inefficient or fragmented value chains. Strengthening and establishing new '\", \"b'value chains through strategic partnerships, collaboration, and co-creation with the private sector '\", \"b'will increase the value of ag products for exports. To achieve these goals, we will also partner '\", \"b'with most vulnerable groups such as Indigenous Peoples, women, and youth as well as returned '\", \"b'migrants. '\", \"b'Leveraging private sector investment. USAID/Guatemala has successful experience using '\", \"b'performance-based competitive funds to attract private sector investment, introduce buyers to '\", \"b'new sourcing regions, facilitate smallholder farmer adoption of technology, and promote youth '\", \"b'entrepreneurship. USAID requests that applicants propose a similar competitive partnership fund '\", \"b'for the Verapaces activity and set aside $6 million of the proposed budget to this fund. '\", \"b'Specifically, applicants should describe their vision for the partnership fund and provide at least '\", \"b'three examples of development challenges in the target region where the private sector could co-'\", \"b'14 '\", \"b'invest to overcome such challenges. Each example should include sample results-based '\", \"b'milestones, including in their reach of women, youth and indigenous peoples, and the total cost '\", \"b'of the partnership indicating both the illustrative USAID and private sector contributions. Private '\", \"b'sector contributions, or leverage, should be required. Note that any construction activities '\", \"b'contemplated should be leveraged by the private sector contribution and will be in accordance '\", \"b'with USAID environmental guidelines. Sample results should be indicative of the business '\", \"b'performance expected in alignment with the expected results of the activity. For example, '\", \"b'volume of sales of agricultural technology solutions including inputs, new farmers formally '\", \"b'contracted, incremental sales of product sourced from the region, among others that would '\", \"b'indicate the commercial viability of the private sector commitment in the future. At least one of '\", \"b'the three development challenge examples should include ideas for youth engagement and the '\", \"b'intersection of youth and agricultural innovation.  '\", \"b'Strengthening new and existing market linkages. Strengthening and establishing new value '\", \"b'chains through strategic partnerships, collaboration, and co-creation with the private sector, '\", \"b'focusing on local actors, will increase the value of exports while at the same time contributing to '\", \"b'long-term sustainable development for farmers in the region. Applicants should demonstrate an '\", \"b'understanding of current market dynamics between smallholder farmers and current buyers. '\", \"b'Then, applicants should offer ideas on whether and how those market connections can be '\", \"b'deepened as well as buyers for existing and new crops. USAID is interested in additional ideas '\", \"b'and partnerships that would result in long-term, sustainable opportunities for youth and '\", \"b'encourages innovative ideas including but not limited to large-scale employment opportunities, '\", \"b'new services, and entrepreneurship. '\", \"b'Access to finance. Many farmers lack the capital required to invest in agricultural technology or '\", \"b'access necessary services that can improve their productivity. A recent study found that members '\", \"b'of indigenous communities (Q\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99eqchi\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and Poqomchi) in Alta Verapaz, particularly women, faced '\", \"b'difficulties undertaking economic activities due to challenges accessing credit within the '\", \"b'Guatemalan financial systems. This activity will coordinate with the upcoming USAID-funded '\", \"b'Economic Growth, Rural Finance activity to connect producers with rural financial providers. In '\", \"b'addition to facilitating access to credit, USAID is also interested in activities that enhance rural '\", \"b'financial services such as financial literacy and planning; access to and investment of '\", \"b'remittances; expanding bankability; accessing mobile money and other digital financial services, '\", \"b'among others. '\", \"b'Objective 3: Resilience to shocks and stressors increased.  '\", \"b'Much of the Guatemalan economy, both current and potential, is heavily reliant on the country\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'diverse and abundant natural resource base. With agriculture accounting for 13.5 percent of '\", \"b'15 '\", \"b'Guatemala\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s GDP and 31 percent of the labor force, the economy is also susceptible to market, '\", \"b'environmental and political shocks and stressors, among these those related to a changing '\", \"b'climate. Given those risks, the Mission\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s approach to agriculture integrates resilience and climate '\", \"b'change adaptation to enhance the sustainability of investments, focusing on social cohesion, '\", \"b'economic inclusion, and strengthening risk management by improving adaptive capacities. The '\", \"b'successful applicant will be expected to coordinate with the USAID-funded Prosperous and '\", \"b'Resilient Sustainable Landscapes Activity. '\", \"b'Improved sustainable agroforestry practices. Extreme poverty and inequality\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94with notable '\", \"b'prevalence among the large Q\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99eqchi\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and Poqomchi\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Indigenous populations\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94is an important '\", \"b'driver of deforestation in the Verapaces.  Communities rely heavily on unsustainable subsistence '\", \"b'farming, full sun cardamom, cattle ranching and sugar cane production. Pesticides and harmful '\", \"b'agrochemicals present an additional threat, as the region is prone to high incidence of pests and '\", \"b'plant diseases. Though the presence of local associations and donor investment has contributed '\", \"b'to widespread improvements in production practices in the region, recent stressors such as the '\", \"b'COVID-19 pandemic and high inflation exposes the fragility of this progress. For example, '\", \"b'pandemic related shutdowns closed markets for SMEs who sell in regional markets in Central '\", \"b'America. Cardamom is a high-opportunity product due to high international demand and its '\", \"b'potential for sustainable production through agroforestry, but the dominant production model '\", \"b'requires unsustainable amounts of wood in the drying process. Producers need innovative '\", \"b'solutions to the drying process, as well as intensified technical and financial investments to make '\", \"b'the conversion to sustainable practices profitable. Applicants should include ideas for '\", \"b'smallholder farmers and associations to implement cardamom drying improvements. USAID is '\", \"b'interested in applicant ideas that build sustainable resilience in farming systems. '\", \"b'Forestry management is another critical strategy for increasing resilience to climate shocks, '\", \"b'improving watersheds, and enhancing farmer livelihoods. The Guatemalan government through '\", \"b'the PINFOR and PINPEP programs offers farmers forestry management incentives. These '\", \"b'incentives programs are an additional income source for farmers in addition to maintaining and '\", \"b'improving forests. Applicants are encouraged to propose activities that will help farmers access '\", \"b'these programs.   '\", \"b'Adoption of climate smart agricultural practices. Livelihood insecurity, particularly for '\", \"b'subsistence farmers, as a result of changing climatic patterns, rising temperatures and/or weather '\", \"b'extremes are likely to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Similar to the adoption of improved '\", \"b'technologies and practices under objective 1, the use of climate smart practices (CSA) can help '\", \"b'farmers adapt to climate variations and build their resilience to these shocks. CSA is a three-'\", \"b'pronged approach that targets sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, '\", \"b'16 '\", \"b'adapting and building resilience to climate change, and reducing greenhouse gas '\", \"b'emissions.  Applicants are encouraged to consider building on and scaling the large cadre of '\", \"b'existing evidence-based farm level technologies and innovations implemented across Guatemala '\", \"b'that increase resource use efficiency while also helping farmers adapt. In addition, applicants '\", \"b'should consider activities using renewable energy for agriculture and agri-food systems.  '\", \"b'Objective 4: Increased adoption of nutrition and hygiene practices  '\", \"b'Nearly half of all children in Guatemala are malnourished, the highest rate in Latin America. A '\", \"b'recent baseline study notes that 70% of families interviewed in Alta Verapaz had an insufficient '\", \"b'diet in terms of variety and quality, which is nearly twice the figure determined by Action '\", \"b'Against Hunger in the territory of the dry corridor in the year 2021(37%). High incidence of '\", \"b'poverty and less than the average household income also prevents families from accessing a '\", \"b'diverse diet, including animal protein. Further contributing to nutritional outcomes is access to '\", \"b'quality water in the home which is critical for hydration and personal hygiene. '\", \"b'Increased consumption of a diverse diet. Feed the Future programming has seen interventions '\", \"b'that focus on nutrition-sensitive agriculture practices and prioritize the first 1,000 days (from '\", \"b'conception to age two) lead to improved nutritional outcomes. Applicants are encouraged to '\", \"b'propose activities that will both increase the availability and consumption of diverse foods. '\", \"b'Potential activities could include market-based solutions for introducing nutrient dense foods '\", \"b'including animal protein into the diet, social behavioral communications and messaging, '\", \"b'nutrition education, among others. Applicants are further encouraged to consider Indigenous and '\", \"b'traditional foods as well as women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s prominent household role into consideration when '\", \"b'designing activities.  '\", \"b'Increased access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services. The baseline study also '\", \"b'highlighted the importance of access to potable water as it relates to food insecurity, as well as '\", \"b'the difficulty this posed for many surveyed households. In target communities, water that is '\", \"b'consumed comes from the harvest, often without adequate processing, which can have a severe '\", \"b'impact on the health of children and the entire population. Municipal government has a vital role '\", \"b'in water access and sanitation services and will be an important partner for this work. As WASH '\", \"b'practices are applicable to both household and on-farm operations, applicants are encouraged to '\", \"b'identify activities that will contribute to both agricultural productivity and improved nutritional '\", \"b'status.  '\", \"b'17 '\", \"b'VII. COORDINATION '\", \"b'Supporting and strengthening the GOG: This new activity will work directly and indirectly '\", \"b'with governmental entities such as: the Ministry of Agriculture (MAGA), National Institute of '\", \"b'Forestry (INAB), Ministry of Health (MOH), Secretariat of Food and Nutritional Security '\", \"b'(SESAN) and local municipalities. In addition, the Verapaces activity will contribute to '\", 'b\"Guatemala\\'s National Development Plan (K\\'atun 2032), the government\\'s school feeding \"', \"b'program, irrigation promotion policy (2013-2023), the national economic recovery plan, the '\", \"b'forest incentive programs and others. MAGA, SESAN, and other institutions have food security '\", \"b'plans that this activity will be critical in supporting. The Verapaces activity will advance the '\", \"b'objectives of each entity and their strategy/plans and be implemented in '\", \"b'coordination/consultation with the institutions and Ministries efforts. For instance, this activity '\", \"b'will support MAGA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s effort by strengthening its extension agents, promoting drip irrigation '\", \"b'systems, promoting nutrition sensitive agriculture activities, with SESAN by promoting '\", \"b'interventions that reduce chronic malnutrition, with the Ministry of Economy by promoting '\", \"b'activities regarding youth ag-startups, creating jobs opportunities, expanding market for '\", \"b'Verapaces agricultural products and, with INAB, this project will leverage expertise and funds '\", \"b'for forest incentive programs for watershed protection.  '\", \"b'Complementary USAID, USG and other Donor Activities: This activity will coordinate '\", \"b'activities with the Interagency group (USAID, Peace Corps, USDA, OTI, and the Inter-American '\", \"b'Foundation (IAF)) that have several activities working on food security initiatives, especially '\", \"b'those in the Verapaces region. This activity, through the Feed the Future team, will maintain '\", \"b'coordination and communication with the donor coordination group. GOG and donor '\", \"b'coordination is done formally at the National Council on Food and Nutritional Security '\", \"b'(CONASAN) level through the Group of Supporters (GIA) from different organizations who '\", \"b'work on food security issues and the Group of Donors and Cooperating Agencies on Food '\", \"b'Security, Nutrition, and Rural Development (G-SAN-DR). In addition, this activity will '\", \"b'coordinate efforts during implementation with USAID projects working in the Verapaces region, '\", \"b'such as the PUENTES, Basic Education Quality Transitions, I-WASH and future Prosperous and '\", \"b'Resilient Landscapes activities and BHA programs. Coordination with other donors, such as '\", \"b'AMEXCID, to leverage expertise from the Sembrando Oportunidades Program through '\", \"b'conditional cash transfers programs which will support producers and youth to improve their '\", \"b'income. At the same time, this activity will continue the relationship between USAID and '\", \"b'MASHAV (Agency for International Development Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign '\", \"b'Affairs of Israel) to train producers in agricultural technology innovation.  '\", \"b'18 '\", \"b'VIII. Cross-cutting Considerations '\", \"b'Sustainability. USAID envisions this activity to be rooted in market-based solutions that can '\", \"b'continue without donor support beyond the life of the activity. Applicants should propose a '\", \"b'business model that explains the commercial viability of select activities five years beyond the '\", \"b'close of the activity. The business model could consider how farmers will continue to access '\", \"b'technical services, how buyers will remain active in and committed to the region, and how the '\", \"b'applicant organization may remain present and engaged in the Verapaces. USAID understands '\", \"b'that this business model will shift during implementation. In addition to the leverage required in '\", \"b'the competitive partnership fund, applicants are expected to contribute cost-share resources to '\", \"b'the activity of a desirable 15% of the total value of the budget.  '\", \"b'Behavior Change Communication. USAID seeks to include Social and Behavior Change '\", \"b'Communication (SBCC)/Social Marketing as a strategy to generate and enhance the generalized '\", \"b'support needed for empowerment and sustainable change. Any efforts will coordinate closely '\", \"b'with and complement existing and related communications efforts. USAID considers social and '\", \"b'behavior change to be a product of multiple overlapping levels of influence, including individual, '\", \"b'interpersonal, community, and organizational, as well as political and environmental factors. As '\", \"b'such, social and behavior change communication is a best practice in development organizations; '\", \"b'an essential basis for effective programming that deepens and expands the impact and '\", \"b'sustainability of development programs.  '\", \"b'Integrated Conflict-Sensitive Analysis. USAID/Guatemala considers social conflict dynamics '\", \"b'in all activities to support the overarching goal of a more secure Guatemala that fosters greater '\", \"b'socio-economic development and sustainably manages its natural resources. Conflict sensitivity '\", \"b'encourages organizations to understand and track conflict dynamics in the contexts in which they '\", \"b'are working. As changes arise, organizations should adapt their activities to minimize their '\", \"b'potential negative effects and build upon their positive effects on conflict. The application of '\", \"b'conflict sensitivity usually does not require a major restructuring of an Activity or an explicit '\", \"b'focus on peacebuilding; adjusting small project details can have significant impacts on '\", \"b'interaction with the conflict context. '\", \"b'In an effort to ensure interventions are conflict-sensitive, USAID/Guatemala requires that '\", \"b'interventions: a) do not inadvertently create or exacerbate social conflict; b) factor in the possible '\", \"b'impact of existing or potential conflict on staff, implementing partners, and the interventions '\", \"b'themselves; c) seek appropriate opportunities to mitigate tensions and sources of conflict; and d) '\", \"b'support constructive collaboration between communities in conflict when possible.  '\", \"b'19 '\", \"b'As part of a conflict-sensitive approach, the Applicant should ensure that all interventions '\", \"b'undertaken do not worsen social conflict dynamics in Activity sites and support constructive '\", \"b'collaboration between communities in conflict, when possible. As part of building a foundation '\", \"b'for social cohesion while also pursuing the sectoral objectives of this Activity, the Activity '\", \"b'should reflect awareness of impacts of trauma on local staff, beneficiaries, and communities, and '\", \"b'incorporate strategies to strengthen trauma resilience. Resources on conflict sensitive practices, '\", \"b'tools, and literature can be found at: http://www.dmeforpeace.org/peacexchange/, '\", \"b'http://cdacollaborative.org/publication/the-do-no-harm-framework-for-analyzing-the- impact-of-'\", \"b'assistance-on-conflict-a-handbook, and '\", \"b'https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1862/Guatemala_Conflict_Vulnerabi '\", \"b'lity_Assessment.pdf.  '\", \"b'Inclusion. The inclusion of key populations, primarily Indigenous Peoples, women, and youth, is '\", \"b'a priority for USAID/Guatemala and is necessary to achieve economic growth given the '\", \"b'proportional representation of these populations within the Verapaces. These Departments have '\", \"b'some of the highest levels of poverty in Guatemala. In Alta Verapaz, 89.5% of the population is '\", \"b'Indigenous. In Baja Verapaz, Indigenous Peoples are a smaller majority at around 57% of the '\", \"b'population.  There are an estimated 800,000 to 1 million youth who are currently not in '\", \"b'education, employment, or training (NEET) in Guatemala. Primary school enrollment in Alta '\", \"b'Verapaz is only around 20%. A combination of limited economic opportunities within '\", \"b'communities and the promise of higher earnings drives many young people, predominantly '\", \"b'young men, to migrate out of rural areas to cities or the United States. Although women make up '\", \"b'roughly 53% of the population, they only comprise 35% of the workforce overall. In rural areas, '\", \"b'only about 30% of women participate in markets, compared to 88% of men, and this inequality is '\", \"b'particularly bad in the Verapaces. Women also face violence both on the streets and in their own '\", \"b'homes. Women in these departments often have their rights violated and may not be aware that '\", \"b'they have rights or decision-making power. Women who are married are sometimes temporarily '\", \"b'or permanently abandoned by their husbands who migrate to seek better economic opportunities, '\", \"b'leaving women to take care of their household and families alone.  '\", \"b'The Feed the Future Guatemala Connecting Value Chains in the Verapaces activity will ensure '\", \"b'that Indigenous Peoples, women, and youth are considered in the design of the overall approach '\", \"b'to achieving the expected results. This approach will be locally led and should be informed by '\", \"b'local stakeholder engagement conducted early in the design process through free, prior, and '\", \"b'informed consent. All activities must be gender sensitive and those that target or include youth '\", \"b'should adopt a Positive Youth Development Framework.  '\", \"b'20 '\", \"b'To advance inclusion goals, the activity could: 1) increase rural women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s participation in '\", \"b'agricultural value chains; 2) create new and better employment opportunities, especially for '\", \"b'Indigenous youth and women; 3) promote access to finance for rural youth and women; 4) '\", \"b'provide incentive structures for Indigenous youth to join agricultural associations and/or '\", \"b'cooperatives; 5) address language and cultural barriers that prevent Indigenous People from '\", \"b'participating in markets; or 6) elevate the role of Indigenous Peoples organizations in decision-'\", \"b'making, especially to integrate traditional knowledge in agricultural development practices.  '\", \"b'Gender Analysis  '\", \"b'This Activity will support the goal of USAID to improve the lives of citizens by advancing '\", \"b'equality between women and girls and men and boys, and empowering women and girls to '\", \"b'participate fully in and benefit from the development of their '\", \"b'societies.  USAID  investments  are  aimed  at  achieving  three  overarching outcomes '\", \"b'to  achieve  the  goal  of  this  policy: 1) '\", \"b'Reduce  gender  disparities  in  access  to,  control  over  and  benefit '\", \"b'from  resources,  wealth,  opportunities,  and  services  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93  economic, '\", \"b'social,  political,  and  cultural; 2) reduce  gender-'\", \"b'based  violence  and  mitigate  its  harmful  effects '\", \"b'on  individuals  and  communities,  so  that  all  people  can  live healthy  and  productive  lives '\", \"b'and,  3)  increase  capability  of  women  and  girls  to  realize  their  rights, '\", \"b'determine  their  life  outcomes,  and  influence  decision making  in '\", \"b'households,  communities,  and  societies. This Activity is expected to reduce gender gaps or '\", \"b'address the unique needs and interests of males and females. '\", \"b'The mandatory gender analysis described in ADS 205 was completed as part of the FtF '\", \"b'Guatemala Connecting Value Chains in the Verapaces key findings and solutions will be '\", \"b'validated with the potential partner. Gender Analysis for the Verapaces Activity. '\", \"b'Collaborating, Learning, and Adapting (CLA) priorities. USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Project Cycle guidance '\", \"b'(ADS 201.3.5.19) provides, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStrategic collaboration, continuous learning, and adaptive '\", \"b'management link together all components of the Project Cycle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Integrating CLA into USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'work helps to ensure that the agency\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s activities are coordinated with others, grounded in a '\", \"b'strong evidence base, and iteratively adapted to remain relevant throughout implementation. This '\", \"b'activity will follow CLA guidance to ensure an adaptable and flexible activity that responds to '\", \"b'lessons learned, dynamic contexts and new knowledge and evidence. '\", \"b'21 '\", \"b'This activity is expected to incorporate a systematic CLA approach that involves strategic '\", \"b'collaboration, continuous learning, and adaptive management. The CLA approach is based on '\", \"b'the understanding that development efforts yield more effective results when coordinated and '\", \"b'collaborative; test promising, new approaches in a continuous manner to identify improvements '\", \"b'and efficiencies; and build on what works and eliminate what does not. CLA creates the '\", \"b'conditions for fostering broader development success by: '\", \"b'Collaborating: Facilitating collaboration internally and with external stakeholders to understand '\", \"b'local systems, context, and relationships, as well as to strengthen locally led socio-economic '\", \"b'development.

Program Description '\", \"b'1. Background '\", \"b'The West Bank and Gaza are located in a water scarce region.  Ongoing water shortages are '\", \"b'exacerbated by the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and the evolving impacts of climate change.  '\", \"b'Despite major USAID and other donor contributions to the improvement and rehabilitation of '\", \"b'Palestinian infrastructure, major portions of the Palestinian population in the West Bank remain '\", \"b'without access to water and sanitation infrastructure and other basic services. '\", \"b'Nearly ten percent (10%) of Palestinian communities in the West Bank remain without access to '\", \"b'piped potable water systems.  Palestinian per capita domestic water consumption in the West '\", \"b'Bank remains about 18 gallons (70 liters) per day.  This is well below World Health Organization '\", \"b'minimum quantity standards required to promote good health and wellbeing, and represents only '\", \"b'about 15 to 25 percent of the Israeli per capita daily consumption.  Without any intervention, the '\", \"b'gap between growing demand and the system\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s limited ability to supply enough water is expected '\", \"b'to approximately triple in the next few years. '\", \"b'Furthermore, deteriorating Palestinian water infrastructure is affecting many Palestinian '\", \"b'communities already connected to existing bulk water supply systems.  Deteriorated and leaking '\", \"b'water distribution networks often result in unsustainable water losses, in some cases reaching fifty '\", \"b'percent (50%).  Proper facilities\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 operations and maintenance is improving, but has been largely '\", \"b'nonexistent due to the Palestinian Authority\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s internal funding constraints and limited technical '\", \"b'capacity.  Service reliability has historically been poor, with interruptions often lasting up to three '\", \"b'weeks, leaving many connected Palestinian communities with little to no water during the hot and '\", \"b'dry summer months when demand for water is greatest.  To meet their minimum water needs, '\", \"b'many Palestinians are forced to rely on unsanitary water purchased from unregulated tanker '\", \"b'trucks at significant expense.  In Palestinian communities not connected at all to the water '\", \"b'network, this can consume as much as thirty percent (30%) of household budgets.   '\", \"b'The situation in the sanitation sector is even more alarming. Some 7.7 to 8.2 billion gallons of '\", \"b'wastewater are generated annually by Palestinians in the West Bank and less than half of the '\", \"b'residents are connected to a sewage collection network.  Only 25 percent to 35 percent of '\", \"b'wastewater generated annually in the West Bank is collected and less than 3 percent is treated.  '\", \"b'Most wastewater is either discharged into leaking septic tanks, unregulated cesspits or is allowed '\", \"b'to flow directly into the wadis (dry river beds), causing local health problems and increasing the '\", \"b'potential of widespread contamination of the water aquifers on which both Israelis and '\", \"b'Palestinians rely. '\", \"b'Another serious problem facing Palestinian communities is the continuing deterioration of '\", \"b'existing infrastructure in the health, education, and transportation sectors and the lack of new '\", \"b'infrastructure to meet the needs of the growing population.  Individuals living in remote '\", \"b'communities in the West Bank face movement restrictions and have limited access to health '\", \"b'facilities, preventing many individuals from receiving essential services and posing significant '\", \"b'safety risks especially to mothers and young children.  In the education sector, despite major '\", \"b'gains in enrollment, there simply aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t enough new classrooms to meet the needs of the growing '\", \"b'population and many existing educational facilities in the West Bank are in deteriorating '\", \"b'condition or lack adequate classrooms and playground facilities.  Children in many communities '\", \"b'Page 6 of 72'\", \"b'must walk long distances under dangerous conditions in order to reach their schools, leading '\", \"b'many, particularly females, to drop out of school. Furthermore, according to the Palestinian '\", \"b'Reform and Development Plan almost 30 percent of the road network in the West Bank requires '\", \"b'reconstruction. '\", \"b'Sustainability is also a pressing concern.  Infrastructure development in the West Bank has '\", \"b'traditionally focused on meeting immediate needs at the lowest construction cost.  At times, this '\", \"b'can result in higher life-cycle costs --such as increased operation and maintenance costs or '\", \"b'equipment/material replacement costs-- that are passed along to the community or the Palestinian '\", \"b'Authority.  Given that limited technical and funding resources exist both at the PA and the '\", \"b'community level to ensure proper operation and maintenance of installed infrastructure and '\", \"b'facilities, this has at times resulted in suboptimal performance of installed infrastructure or a '\", \"b'faster than expected deterioration of constructed facilities. '\", \"b'2. The Development Problem '\", \"b'The USAID/West Bank and Gaza (USAID/WBG) Mission\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s infrastructure strategy is to improve '\", \"b'social and economic development through increased access to new and improved public '\", \"b'infrastructure facilities and services.  As part of this strategy, the Mission has funded the '\", \"b'construction of large-scale water and roads infrastructure as well as smaller, village-scale health '\", \"b'and education projects throughout the West Bank.  This mixed approach meets the PA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s priorities '\", \"b'in the West Bank while also addressing the needs of rural, vulnerable or under-served '\", \"b'communities in both the West Bank and Gaza.   '\", \"b'Currently, USAID/WBG is funding the design and construction of large scale road, water and '\", \"b'wastewater projects through the Infrastructure Needs Program.  The emergency water and '\", \"b'sanitation needs of rural, vulnerable or under-served communities in both the West Bank and '\", \"b'Gaza are being addressed through the Emergency Water and Sanitation Program (EWAS I and '\", \"b'EWAS II). This program is expected to end by 2013. '\", \"b'USAID/WBG is also addressing the needs of rural, vulnerable or under-served communities in '\", \"b'the West Bank through the Local Government and Infrastructure Program (LGI).  Through a '\", \"b'participatory process, LGI engages communities to provide the basic infrastructure needed for '\", \"b'sustainable improvements in the quality of life of Palestinians and promotes an enabling '\", \"b'environment for good local governance.  LGI, however, generally focuses on addressing the '\", \"b'needs of target communities for physical facilities such as schools, clinics, municipal buildings '\", \"b'and youth centers. '\", \"b'In the water sector, there is a pressing need to connect rural, vulnerable or under-served '\", \"b'communities without piped water systems to existing bulk water supply systems and to '\", \"b'rehabilitate existing deteriorated water distribution networks.  New connections will dramatically '\", \"b'improve household budgets in these communities, improve health and well-being, and contribute '\", \"b'to the achievement of Palestinian Authority goals.  Water loss reduction through improved '\", \"b'infrastructure has the potential to save as much as 10 billion gallons per year and help address the '\", \"b'growing water supply/demand deficit. '\", \"b'Additionally, in the wastewater sector, few communities have proper sewage collection systems, '\", \"b'with most of the sewage produced being discharged untreated directly into the environment.  New '\", \"b'collection networks in target communities will eliminate household reliance on unregulated '\", \"b'cesspits and leaky septic tanks and will facilitate future connection to planned wastewater '\", \"b'treatment plants. '\", \"b'Page 7 of 72'\", \"b'A new program is therefore needed to respond to the water and sanitation-related needs of rural, '\", \"b'vulnerable or under-served communities in the West Bank and to complement other USAID '\", \"b'activities in selected locations. '\", \"b'3. Program Objective '\", \"b'The Palestinian Community Infrastructure Development (PCID) Program aims to increase '\", \"b'Palestinian access to water, sanitation and other small and medium scale community '\", \"b'infrastructure in the West Bank. '\", \"b'This focus will be complemented by a minimum stand-by capability to respond rapidly to needs '\", \"b'in Gaza should political and security conditions require.  Any interventions in Gaza will be '\", \"b'identified and discussed by USAID and the implementing partner on a case by case basis after '\", \"b'award.  No interventions in Gaza are contemplated at this time. '\", \"b'Accordingly, PCID will meet the following objectives: '\", \"b'Increase access to water and sanitation systems, reduce water losses and enhance water and '\", \"b'sanitation system sustainability: '\", \"b'PCID will construct new and renovate existing water and sanitation networks and systems to '\", \"b'provide communities with new water connections, improve the reliability of water delivery, '\", \"b'reduce water losses from deteriorating or otherwise inadequate infrastructure, and reduce the '\", \"b'potential of long-term contamination of the water aquifers.  At least sixty percent (60%) of PCID '\", \"b'resources will be used to address water and sanitation needs in Palestinian communities.  '\", \"b'Increase the impact of USAID-funded programs in health, democracy and governance, education '\", \"b'and the private sector by addressing underlying infrastructure needs which may be limiting the '\", \"b'impact of those programs: '\", \"b'PCID will also have the capacity to support the construction of other infrastructure needed to '\", \"b'address critically needed basic infrastructure shortages.  These activities include the construction '\", \"b'and renovation of health facilities, schools and youth centers, as well as the implementation of '\", \"b'other community infrastructure projects.   '\", \"b'Respond rapidly to urgent water, sanitation and other public infrastructure needs: '\", \"b'PCID will provide rapid response to urgent infrastructure needs in the West Bank, East Jerusalem '\", \"b'or Gaza identified in coordination with USAID. '\", \"b'Window of Opportunity: '\", \"b'Up to 5 percent of the total budget may be reserved for unforeseen priority opportunities which '\", \"b'adhere to the overall objective of the project. '\", \"b'4. Technical Considerations '\", \"b'Contingent upon the availability of funds, USAID/WBG intends to award an assistance '\", \"b'instrument (cooperative agreement) to support the PCID initiative.  USAID anticipates that one '\", \"b'assistance instrument will be awarded. '\", \"b'Page 8 of 72'\", \"b'PCID will focus on rural, vulnerable or under-served communities in the West Bank that face '\", \"b'serious shortages in basic services. This is consistent with the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPalestinian National Development '\", \"b'Plan 2011-13,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (PNDP) which stresses the importance of connecting marginalized communities '\", \"b'to public infrastructure networks. The quality of life in these communities continues to lag far '\", \"b'behind other West Bank communities, and significant disparities abound between rural and urban '\", \"b'communities within the same districts. The PNDP stresses the importance of investing in national '\", \"b'infrastructure to enable the rapid implementation of social and economic development initiatives '\", \"b'and interventions in all Palestinian communities. '\", \"b'PCID is expected to achieve its program objectives despite the problems of constrained access '\", \"b'and mobility and other difficulties associated with the current tense political and security situation '\", \"b'in the West Bank.  In light of this, any applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s proposed technical approach to achieving the '\", \"b'stated objectives must demonstrate explicit capabilities to concurrently implement water, '\", \"b'sanitation and other infrastructure activities under difficult and rapidly changing operating '\", \"b'conditions. '\", \"b'The key principles guiding the technical approach should include: meeting water and sanitation '\", \"b'needs of selected communities; technical excellence in design; effective coordination '\", \"b'mechanisms; gender sensitivity and sound sustainability mechanisms. '\", \"b'The Recipient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s main responsibility under PCID is to ensure proper monitoring and evaluation of '\", \"b'all activities implemented under the program.  To successfully implement PCID, the Recipient '\", \"b'should consider implementing PCID projects through partnerships with competent local '\", \"b'engineering and construction firms to ensure that the needed planning, engineering design, '\", \"b'construction and construction oversight of PCID infrastructure projects achieve the objectives of '\", \"b'this program. Selecting competent, qualified and capable local firm(s) to partner with is a key '\", \"b'factor to the successful implementation of high quality infrastructure work. '\", \"b'Program design should be based to a great extent on the ongoing water, sanitation and other '\", \"b'infrastructure needs in the West Bank. The mid-term evaluation of the USAID-funded '\", \"b'Emergency Water and Sanitation and Other Infrastructure Program (EWAS II) which was '\", \"b'conducted in February and March 2012, will help shape program design and inform the project '\", \"b'selection process.  '\", \"b'PCID will build on past USAID program evaluations and community needs assessments to '\", \"b'develop an initial rapid assessment that identifies unmet needs (primarily in the water and '\", \"b'sanitation sectors and secondarily in other sectors) and conceptually proposes sustainable '\", \"b'solutions/options. This assessment should build on the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCommunity Vulnerability Assessment\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d '\", \"b'conducted in December 2010 by the Applied Research Institute \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Jerusalem (ARIJ).  A summary '\", \"b'of the main findings of the assessment is attached to this Program Description as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAttachment B.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  '\", \"b'The ARIJ assessment identified a list of the most vulnerable communities in the West Bank and '\", \"b'ranked communities based on data collected on the water and wastewater, education, health, '\", \"b'economy and food security, physical infrastructure and development sectors. While the ARIJ '\", \"b'assessment should help inform the PCID project selection process, all applications should clearly '\", \"b'explain the proposed assessment methodology and clearly describe the proposed criteria for the '\", \"b'selection of communities and projects.  '\", \"b'The Recipient must hold consultations with PA counterparts, specifically the Palestinian Water '\", \"b'Authority (PWA) and the West Bank Water Department (WBWD), to seek their inputs and '\", \"b'considerations in the development of final prioritized lists of communities identified as requiring '\", \"b'Page 9 of 72'\", \"b'assistance. Furthermore, in coordination with USAID and through the USAID/WBG inter-office '\", \"b'collaborative process, other infrastructure will be identified for improvement such as education, '\", \"b'health, and other public facilities. Assistance may also include the provision of training and '\", \"b'equipment to help local communities operate and maintain any new facilities.  USAID and the '\", \"b'Recipient will agree to prioritized lists of communities and their respective infrastructure needs '\", \"b'based on stakeholder input, evaluations, and on field assessments.   '\", \"b'It is critical that the Recipient\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s PCID team be able to mobilize quickly; rapidly and effectively '\", \"b'assess water, sanitation and other community-level public infrastructure needs; develop '\", \"b'sustainable solutions that the community and/or PA are technically and financially capable of '\", \"b'operating and maintaining; and accelerate the planning, design and construction process while '\", \"b'maintaining transparency and quality standards. '\", \"b'5. Coordination Mechanisms '\", \"b'The Recipient must present to USAID, in their application and in subsequent work plans, their '\", \"b'proposed methods of coordination and any proposed coordination mechanisms. The Recipient is '\", \"b'expected to seek input from and coordinate closely with Palestinian ministries and institutions, '\", \"b'local NGOs and USAID implementing partners to annually update and maintain prioritized lists '\", \"b'of communities that are in need of improved infrastructure. '\", \"b'Furthermore, the infrastructure project planning, design and implementation process will require '\", \"b'extensive coordination efforts throughout with the Israeli District Civil Liaison Office (DCL) in '\", \"b'order to achieve requisite permits when activities are located in areas under full Israeli '\", \"b'administrative control (i.e. Area C of the West Bank as designated by the Oslo Accords); security '\", \"b'approvals when activities are located in areas under Israeli security control (i.e. Area B of the '\", \"b'West Bank as designated by the Oslo Accords); and to allow the entry and movement of '\", \"b'construction staff, equipment and materials into and within the West Bank throughout any '\", \"b'construction activities. '\", \"b'The Recipient is expected to develop a positive working relationship with Israeli and Palestinian '\", \"b'authorities and to lead any coordination needed between target municipalities and the DCL.  '\", \"b'USAID will play an active role by assisting in, but not assuming the primary responsibility for, '\", \"b'developing a coordination mechanism among these different stakeholders; primary responsibility '\", \"b'resides with the Recipient. '\", \"b'As per established Mission policy, contact by USAID or its partners is not allowed with any '\", \"b'individuals affiliated with a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). Contact means any meeting, '\", \"b'telephone conversation or other communication, oral or written. '\", \"b'6. Expected Outcomes and Results '\", \"b'At least sixty percent (60%) of PCID activities will be in the water and sanitation sectors. The '\", \"b'program is expected to increase connectivity to clean potable water networks and reduce water '\", \"b'losses in rural, vulnerable or under-served Palestinian communities. In addition, the program will '\", \"b'alleviate some of the problems caused by deteriorated or otherwise inadequate sewage and '\", \"b'sanitation systems in some of the most affected Palestinian communities. The program will also '\", \"b'meet selected basic infrastructure needs by constructing and rehabilitating physical facilities such '\", \"b'as health centers, schools and youth centers, as well as implementing community infrastructure '\", \"b'projects, including but not limited to the construction and rehabilitation of parks, libraries, '\", \"b'Page 10 of 72'\", \"b'sidewalks and roads leading to public infrastructure. Program activities may also include the '\", \"b'paving and upgrading of sidewalks and roads needed to improve access to physical facilities.   '\", \"b'While the specific number of systems and/or facilities cannot be determined at this stage, it is '\", \"b'estimated that within the five years of program implementation, more than 80 water and/or '\", \"b'sanitation systems, and more than 50 education, health and other public facilities will be '\", \"b'constructed or rehabilitated. '\", \"b'7. Gender '\", \"b'USAID/WBG recently commissioned a gender analysis of its programs, which identified gaps '\", \"b'and recommendations for future activities. The four gaps identified in the infrastructure sector '\", \"b'were: '\", \"b'\\\\xef\\\\x82\\\\xb7 '\", \"b'The lack of gender sensitivity in community needs assessments. '\", \"b'\\\\xef\\\\x82\\\\xb7 '\", \"b'The infrastructure sector largely remains male-dominated.  Women are perceived as '\", \"b'beneficiaries rather than contributors. '\", \"b'\\\\xef\\\\x82\\\\xb7 '\", \"b'Insufficient opportunities exist for women and youth to participate in maintenance '\", \"b'training programs to enable new infrastructure business start-ups. '\", \"b'\\\\xef\\\\x82\\\\xb7 '\", \"b'Sex-disaggregated employment and infrastructure business data are weak and provide '\", \"b'insufficient insights on the participation of women and men and other gender issues in '\", \"b'infrastructure. '\", \"b'The program will encourage the inclusion of women among project staff and the PCID Request '\", \"b'for Application (RFA) will require bidding nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to include a '\", \"b'section addressing one or more of the four above-mentioned gender gaps. In developing its plans '\", \"b'to address one or more of the identified gender gaps, the Recipient should involve female '\", \"b'community members whenever applicable in the selection, design, follow-up and supervision of '\", \"b'activities. Additionally, separate assessment meetings with male and female community members '\", \"b'should be led by male or female facilitators (as appropriate) in order to gain a more gender-'\", \"b'balanced view of the communities\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 priorities. As a result, it is estimated that more than 20 '\", \"b'activities will be implemented to address women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s needs in the community. '\", \"b'The process of project identification must be designed to explicitly encourage the proactive '\", \"b'identification and incorporation of the needs expressed by women in the community. Applicants '\", \"b'are encouraged to include new opportunities for women, particularly disadvantaged or vulnerable '\", \"b'women, and to design activities that improve the living conditions and the quality of life for '\", \"b'Palestinian women and their families. Based on the different needs and roles of men and women '\", \"b'(boys/girls), strategies for addressing these needs and for ensuring full female participation in all '\", \"b'proposed activities must be part of the methodology/proposed approach.  '\", \"b'Furthermore, the program strategy shall demonstrate how activities will be monitored, tracked '\", \"b'and evaluated to measure the impact on women. USAID will evaluate the gender approaches '\", \"b'included in each application. During program implementation, USAID will monitor the Recipient '\", \"b'to ensure that gender equity concerns are met in all aspects of PCID implementation. '\", \"b'Page 11 of 72'\", \"b'8. Environmental Guidelines '\", \"b'1a) The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, Section 117 requires that the impact of '\", \"b'USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s activities on the environment be considered and that USAID include environmental '\", \"b'sustainability as a central consideration in designing and carrying out its development programs. '\", \"b'This mandate is codified in Federal Regulations (22 CFR 216) and in USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Automated '\", \"b'Directives System (ADS) Parts 201.3.11(b) and 204 (http://www.usaid.gov/policy/ads/200/), '\", \"b'which, in part, require that the potential environmental impacts of USAID-financed activities be '\", \"b'identified prior to a final decision to proceed in implementing the program and that appropriate '\", \"b'environmental safeguards are adopted for all activities.  Environmental compliance requirements '\", \"b'under these regulations and procedures are specified in the following paragraphs of this RFA. '\", \"b'1b) In addition, the recipient must comply with host country environmental regulations unless '\", \"b'otherwise directed in writing by USAID.

The objectives of the USAID Disability Policy are (1) to enhance the attainment of United '\", \"b'States foreign assistance program goals by promoting the participation and equalization of '\", \"b'opportunities of individuals with disabilities in USAID policy, country and sector strategies, '\", \"b'activity designs and implementation; (2) to increase awareness of issues of people with '\", \"b'disabilities both within USAID programs and in host countries; (3) to engage other U.S. '\", \"b'Government agencies, host country counterparts, governments, implementing organizations and '\", \"b'other donors in fostering a climate of nondiscrimination against people with disabilities; and (4) '\", \"b'to support international advocacy for people with disabilities. The full text of the policy paper can '\", \"b'be found at the following Web site: pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABQ631.pdf '\", \"b'b.

To that end and to the extent it can accomplish this goal within the scope '\", \"b'Page 52 of 72'\", \"b'of the program objectives, the recipient should demonstrate a comprehensive and consistent '\", \"b'approach for including men, women, and children with disabilities.

'\", \"b'A.1. '\", \"b'Guinea Local Health System Strengthening (GLHSS) Overview '\", \"b'USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health office proposes the design of a new health sector activity entitled: Guinea '\", \"b'Local Health System Strengthening (GLHSS). Its design involved USAID/Guinea, '\", \"b'USAID/Washington, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and stakeholders working in the health sector. '\", \"b'This co-engagement process will continue during the five-year implementation phase and will '\", \"b'identify health topics on which additional information is needed.  '\", \"b'The core development problem that GLHSS will address is poor health outcomes. This problem '\", \"b'will be addressed by responding to key challenges to the efficient functioning of the health system, '\", \"b'with a particular emphasis on the local level. These challenges can be categorized into the following '\", \"b'seven broad areas: Accessibility, Affordability and Quality of Care; Supply Chain Management; '\", \"b'Leadership, Management and Governance; Human Resources; Health Information System; Social '\", \"b'and Behavior Change; and Funding for the Health Sector.  GLHSS will result in improved delivery '\", \"b'of integrated health services in targeted areas, establishment of health enhancing social norms, '\", \"b'stronger democratic norms and processes, and increased use of strategic information for decision-'\", \"b'making. '\", \"b'The co-engagement process will maximize the use of innovative approaches to addressing the '\", \"b'challenges facing Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health sector. This process will require the rigorous collection of '\", \"b'relevant data and information, and close collaboration for the life-of-project with key stakeholders '\", \"b'in Guinea, MOH officials at the national and local levels, other donor representatives and concerned '\", \"b'community leaders. '\", \"b'Throughout this process, creativity and flexibility on the part of the selected implementation agent '\", \"b'in achieving stated activity objectives will be encouraged. Preference will be given to the formation '\", \"b'of an implementation consortium that includes sub-awards to qualified local organizations.  '\", \"b'Moreover, an important element is the manner in which issues concerning gender, youth and people '\", \"b'with disabilities are addressed. Also the implementing agent will be expected to involve '\", \"b'USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Democracy and Governance Office in the conduct of activities designed to '\", \"b'strengthen democratic norms at the community level.  '\", \"b'The activity will be implemented in the U.S. Presidential Malaria Initiative (PMI) target regions, '\", \"b'namely the three regions of Bok\\\\xc3\\\\xa9, Kindia and Lab\\\\xc3\\\\xa9, and five communes of the capital city of '\", \"b'Conakry.  Together, these regions cover an estimated 50% of Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s total population. The activity '\", \"b'will be designed and implemented with sufficient flexibility to allow changes as needed in its '\", \"b'geographical focus zones so as to reflect Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s evolving political, social and health situations. '\", \"b'7 '\", \"b'It will also have the flexibility to adjust its scope according to available funding resources and crisis '\", \"b'situations. '\", \"b'GLHSS will contribute to sustainable improvements in the health status of target populations in '\", \"b'these three regions and five Conakry communes.  Thus, it directly supports the Mission\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'Development Objective (DO) 1: Increased Capacity and Commitment of the Local Health System '\", \"b'for Better Health Outcomes. GLHSS will be the central pillar of USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health service '\", \"b'delivery and capacity building portfolio. It also consolidates two current USAID/Guinea bilateral '\", \"b'health activities: Health Services Delivery (HSD) and Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s flagship PMI activity.  '\", \"b'GLHSS will apply a systems approach that uses USAID resources to leverage and influence other '\", \"b'actors, internal and external, working in Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health sector. For example, USAID will '\", \"b'collaborate closely with not only the MOH, but also with other donors such as the Global Fund to '\", \"b'Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World '\", \"b'Bank. The aim will be to improve the accountability, management and decision-making capacity '\", \"b'of local health system actors so that they are able to provide quality health services within targeted '\", \"b'health districts. A strong emphasis will be placed on ensuring the integration of principles of equity, '\", \"b'quality and resource optimization into the health delivery system at the community level.  '\", \"b'A.2 '\", \"b'Alignment with USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Country Development Cooperation Strategy '\", \"b'(CDCS), 2021 - 2025  '\", \"b'The goal of this new five-year CDCS is: More participatory governance for a healthier, more '\", \"b'prosperous Guinea.

The first DO is: Increased capacity and commitment of the '\", \"b'local health system for better health outcomes. This DO 1 is linked with, and supportive of, the '\", \"b'second DO: Democratic and economic governance strengthened. The linkage between DOs 1 and '\", \"b'2 will be of the most importance for GLHSS at the decentralized level in the application of measures '\", \"b'which improve the local governance of Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health system. '\", \"b'GLHSS will stress creating gender- and youth-sensitive local health services. It will also partner '\", \"b'with local private sector entities, CSOs, FBOs and women-led organizations to support and amplify '\", \"b'its implementation. These partnerships fit well with USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s New Partnership Initiative (NPI) and '\", \"b'its Private Sector Engagement (PSE) policies. The successful implementation of GLHSS will '\", \"b'enable the strengthening of health governance and accountability, especially at the local level. '\", \"b'A.3 '\", \"b'Development Hypothesis '\", \"b'The overarching development hypothesis is that IF local health systems ensure quality and '\", \"b'affordable health service provision; support norms and behaviors that enhance health; operate '\", \"b'according to democratic norms and procedures; have sufficient funding, and use available data to '\", \"b'inform decisions, THEN the local health systems will demonstrate increased capacity and '\", \"b'8 '\", \"b'commitment to better health outcomes, and, thereby, engender greater trust by communities in the '\", \"b'health system.  '\", \"b'Underlying this central hypothesis are the following points: '\", \"b'IF health facilities and human resources are managed more effectively and at the decentralized '\", \"b'level; health facilities have the required equipment, tools, training, and medicines; and health '\", \"b'services are delivered in a people-centered fashion, THEN the local health system will have ensured '\", \"b'the availability of quality, affordable and gender- and youth-responsive health services. '\", \"b'IF the targeted population and health care workers have the knowledge and beliefs needed to '\", \"b'practice health-enhancing behaviors; health care workers provide unbiased care according to '\", \"b'protocols; and key social and behavior change messages are disseminated in an effective manner, '\", \"b'THEN an enabling environment for health-enhancing social norms and behaviors will be '\", \"b'established. '\", \"b'IF local government responsiveness to the male and female population\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s concerns can be improved; '\", \"b'civil society and media advocacy strengthened; targeted national level institutions strengthened; '\", \"b'and consensus building increased among local stakeholders, THEN democratic processes that '\", \"b'support improved health outcomes will be strengthened. '\", \"b'Investments that support the increased capacity of local health systems and encourage local actors '\", \"b'to demonstrate their commitment to improved health outcomes are crucial for Guinea to move along '\", \"b'the path towards greater self-reliance. In particular, local government entities will be encouraged to '\", \"b'include in their plan funds needed to improve health services in their communities. '\", \"b'USAID/Guinea proposes to focus primarily on decentralized levels to strengthen the local health '\", \"b'system to support improved health outcomes. The provision of quality services requires well-'\", \"b'managed human resources within health service delivery points; necessary equipment, '\", \"b'infrastructure, training, tools, and health consumables; and making health services available and '\", \"b'affordable to all members of the population, including women, youth, marginalized and vulnerable '\", \"b'groups.  '\", \"b'Local health system actors are also critical in reinforcing positive social norms and governing the '\", \"b'use of human and financial resources destined for the sector. Focusing on these areas, and using '\", \"b'accurate information for decision-making across these areas, will create the necessary enabling '\", \"b'environment for better health outcomes, particularly at the community level. '\", \"b'A.4 '\", \"b'Critical Assumptions and Risk Factors '\", \"b'The critical assumptions that underpin this new activity include the following: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f The Government of Guinea (GOG) remains committed to both its decentralization and '\", \"b'community health strategies. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Current donor funding levels for Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health sector do not decrease. '\", \"b'9 '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f USAID/Guinea will be able to identify effective incentives to strengthen the accountability '\", \"b'of local health system actors. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f GOG and other relevant institutions are receptive to addressing any inequities in the health '\", \"b'system which diminish the care provided to women and youth. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s implementing partners will be able to identify positive change agents at '\", \"b'the district, facility and the community level who can serve as models to other regions. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f The local health system will continue to function at a sufficient level to allow for the '\", \"b'delivery of health services and the engagement of USAID. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f The Government of Guinea continues to provide funds to the health sector;1 and '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f No substantial changes in USAID funding to Guinea.  '\", \"b'USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Health Office has also identified the following possible health risks: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Probability of outbreaks of other infectious diseases, as experienced during the 2014-2016 '\", \"b'Ebola outbreak and in early 2021 with some Ebola cases reported in Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Forest Region, '\", \"b'and the Marburg case reported in 2021. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f The advent of a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic could increase economic and food '\", \"b'security hardships for the Guinean people, especially girls, women, youth, the marginalized '\", \"b'and the most vulnerable. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Misappropriation of Government of Guinea health resources could occur, resulting in '\", \"b'underfunding of health activities; and  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f An upsurge in the COVID-19 pandemic could reduce the use and delivery of routine health '\", \"b'services and disrupt the procurement of essential medicines, as well as regular childhood '\", \"b'vaccination and mosquito bed net distribution campaigns. '\", \"b'Overall, the evolving situation in Guinea could increase its fragility. Already, Guinea is ranked 15th '\", \"b'from the bottom of a list ranking 179 countries on the 2020 Fragile States Index. Except for Nigeria, '\", \"b'Guinea was ranked as the most fragile country in West Africa. '\", \"b'The design of this new activity will take into account the assumptions and risks outlined above, '\", \"b'incorporating sufficient flexibility so that implementation can readily be adjusted to reflect the '\", \"b'realities of the evolving operational situation and unforeseen circumstances. '\", \"b'A.5 '\", \"b'Problem Statement and Rationale '\", \"b'The GOG\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s MOH National Health Development Plan (PNDS), 2015-2024, characterizes Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'health system as being weak and, thus, its overall performance is poor.2 The PNDS cites low '\", \"b'coverage (estimated at about 50 percent) of the population with essential quality health services. It '\", \"b'1 The export of bauxite, diamonds and gold represents nearly 80 percent of the GOG\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s revenue.

As indicated below, this new activity will be designed to respond to key '\", \"b'shortcomings in Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health status, particularly in targeted communities. '\", \"b'The PNDS describes Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health status as follows: morbidity and mortality levels are still too '\", \"b'high, especially among vulnerable groups, including mothers and newborns; weak coverage for '\", \"b'most of the essential health services and the doubtful quality of those services; inefficient and '\", \"b'inequitable provision of health services; and an operational environment constrained by important '\", \"b'obstacles and constraints, notably in the areas of adequate equipment and infrastructure. It notes '\", \"b'this environment was worsened by the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak and the health system is still '\", \"b'recovering from the devastating impact of this epidemic. '\", \"b'The 2018 DHS does show some progress over the previous 2012 DHS.3 For example, in the 2018 '\", \"b'DHS, 53 percent of women used maternity services available at their local health facilities whereas '\", \"b'in 2012 it was reported that 40 percent of women used these services and 47 percent delivered their '\", \"b'babies at home.4 Therefore, progress is possible, but many barriers remain to be overcome to ensure '\", \"b'that an adequate level of quality health care is available to all Guineans. '\", \"b'A high variability of health services provided at local facilities demonstrates that serious issues of '\", \"b'accessibility, affordability, acceptability, equity and quality persist. Financial barriers remain the '\", \"b'most cited reason (60 percent) that women do not seek care at a health facility. The limited number '\", \"b'of available skilled health workers (e.g., physicians, nurses and midwives) is also a serious concern, '\", \"b'particularly in rural areas. This shortage of skilled workers, especially women, is highlighted by the '\", \"b'lack of competent health providers who are able to provide quality emergency obstetric and '\", \"b'newborn care in many health facilities. '\", \"b'Family planning5 (FP) is another area where much progress is needed. While the use of modern '\", \"b'contraceptives is increasing, the unmet need for FP remains high at 22 percent and the overall '\", \"b'demand is 33 percent. The persistent high unmet need for FP information and services reflects '\", \"b'systematic obstacles to potential FP users.  '\", \"b'The failure of the MOH to provide adequate vaccination coverage to children under five years of '\", \"b'age against childhood diseases demonstrates one of the most important weaknesses of Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'health system. According to the DHS, immunization rates for this age group fell from 37 percent in '\", \"b'2012 to 24 percent in 2018, meaning almost one in four children in this age group has not received '\", \"b'any of the recommended immunizations.

'\", \"b'5 At present, USAID family planning programming is restricted to activities that do not directly support the '\", \"b'government due to Section 7008 restrictions invoked following the September 2021 coup.  These restrictions will '\", \"b'remain in place until officials of a duly elected government take office.  Therefore, GLHSS will need to be '\", \"b'adequately flexible to focus family planning efforts exclusively on the private sector and communities, while '\", \"b'remaining prepared to also incorporate family planning support to the government at such time as this may be '\", \"b'allowed. '\", \"b'11 '\", \"b'This low immunization rate has resulted in recurrent measles outbreaks in various regions. These '\", \"b'outbreaks contribute to the continued high mortality rate of children under five years of age. The '\", \"b'2018 DHS reported 111 deaths per 1,000 live births. Neonatal births represented almost half of '\", \"b'these deaths (48 percent). Other than these neonatal deaths, the key contributors to the deaths of '\", \"b'children under five years of age are malaria, diarrhea and undernutrition.  '\", \"b'The high incidence of malaria in Guinea is worthy of special note. According to the MOH, malaria '\", \"b'is endemic in Guinea and the leading cause of clinical consultations, hospitalizations and hospital '\", \"b'deaths. Malaria is the biggest killer of children under the age of five (over 14 percent in this age '\", \"b'group). Pregnant women have a high risk of contracting malaria. In response, PMI is the largest '\", \"b'USG health care investment in Guinea.  PMI is the largest funding stream for GLHSS.  '\", \"b'Sub-optimal health behaviors sustained by socio-cultural factors contribute to high rates of '\", \"b'preventable child and maternal deaths and infectious diseases. There is also a range of poor health '\", \"b'practices related to hygiene and nutrition. In addition, harmful traditional practices such as female '\", \"b'genital mutilation and cutting (FGM/C), early marriage and the low educational attainment of '\", \"b'women and girls contribute to poor health status.  '\", \"b'The low level of health service utilization in Guinea is influenced by a number of factors, including '\", \"b'a perceived low quality of health services and a general lack of confidence in the public health '\", \"b'system. Other contributing factors include incorrect knowledge and attitudes about health behaviors '\", \"b'and risks. Another factor is the inconsistent quality and scale of social and behavior change (SBC) '\", \"b'programming.  '\", \"b'A.6 '\", \"b'Structure of Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Health System and Key Challenges '\", \"b'The administrative structure of Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health system is depicted in the pyramidal graphic shown '\", \"b'below. At the top of the graphic, the MOH headquarters in the capital city of Conakry includes 10 '\", \"b'national health directorates, six disease control programs and two university hospitals. At the next '\", \"b'lower level are eight regional directorates, one for each of Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eight governmental '\", \"b'administrative regions. Each of these regional directorates covers three to five health districts. There '\", \"b'are 38 health districts managed by their respective district directorates. Under these districts are 413 '\", \"b'health centers which cover collectively 963 health posts. Altogether, the MOH is staffed nationally '\", \"b'with about 12,000 paid employees and about 10,000 community health workers supported by '\", \"b'partners. '\", \"b'12 '\", \"b'The following analysis of the Guinean health system is based on the interrelated and mutually '\", \"b'reinforcing components of the World Health Organization\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (WHO) Health Systems '\", \"b'Framework for Action for Strengthening Health Systems.6 This framework emphasizes '\", \"b'addressing bottlenecks in a collaborative, coordinated way, driven by desired health '\", \"b'outcomes, to achieve sustainable system-wide effects. WHO also stresses that any effort to '\", \"b'strengthen a health system must be a country-led process that is based on priorities set in a '\", \"b'comprehensive national health strategy as has been done in the PNDS. '\", \"b'The design of GLHSS is also guided by the publications of USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Bureau for Global '\", \"b'Health\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Office of Health Systems. This office has noted the importance of the connection '\", \"b'between formal health and community systems. This office describes the community health '\", \"b'system as a set of local actors, relationships and processes engaged in producing, advocating '\", \"b'for and supporting health in communities and households outside, but related to, the formal '\", \"b'health system. This office also notes a growing recognition that effective partnerships '\", \"b'between communities and health systems are needed to achieve and sustain positive health '\", \"b'outcomes. In addition, a whole-of-society approach is considered an important factor that '\", \"b'will contribute to the success of GLHSS. (See referenced USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Vision for Health '\", \"b'System Strengthening 2030\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 released in April 2021.) '\", \"b'GLHSS focuses on making the health system work at the community level in its targeted '\", \"b'geographic zones in order to expand universal primary health care on a sustainable basis. An '\", \"b'underlying principle of this new activity is to develop a model which can be replicated in '\", \"b'other regions of Guinea. The adoption of this model in other regions of Guinea will be an '\", \"b'indicator of GLHSS\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 success.  '\", \"b'SBC is an important element of GLHSS due to the pivotal role of behaviors on health '\", \"b'outcomes, including behaviors of clients, health service providers, and health system '\", \"b'managers. The USAID health program portfolio will focus on the community level, but also '\", \"b'works at the central and operational (prefectural) levels to strengthen the health system at the '\", \"b'local level. All work will be undertaken in close and constructive collaboration with '\", \"b'concerned MOH officials, other donor representatives and stakeholders working in Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'health sector. '\", \"b'A summary description of seven key challenge areas facing Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health sector is '\", \"b'provided below. GLHSS will be designed to address to the maximum extent possible these '\", \"b'formidable challenges and, thereby, improve the quality of health care and make Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'health system more resilient and sensitive to gender and youth issues at every level, '\", \"b'especially at the household and community levels.  '\", \"b'Challenge 1: Accessibility, Affordability and Quality of Care '\", \"b'Variations in the geographic distribution of the cost of services and standards of practice limit the '\", \"b'Guinean population\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s access to skilled health personnel and quality health services. These '\", \"b'6 World Health Organization, Framework for Action for Strengthening Health Systems, 2007. '\", \"b'https://www.who.int/healthsystems/strategy/en/ '\", \"b'13 '\", \"b'variations are exacerbated by the fact that the Guinean health system relies heavily on international '\", \"b'donor support. Donors may subsidize their priority technical areas, certain health districts and health '\", \"b'facilities. In this context, effective donor coordination at the health district level is essential to '\", \"b'provide targeted populations with all the health care services they need.  '\", \"b'Although data on health financing is limited in Guinea, it is estimated, as previously noted, that '\", \"b'households contribute the most (62 percent) to total health spending. Yet, the abject poverty of most '\", \"b'Guineans means they cannot afford health care services. It is expected that Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s high level of '\", \"b'poverty could deepen because of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of its vast mineral '\", \"b'wealth, Guinea is ranked in the low human development category of the UN Development '\", \"b'Program\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (UNDP) annual Human Development Index (HDI). In 2020, Guinea was ranked 178 out '\", \"b'of 189 countries on the HDI. '\", \"b'Multiple factors impact the quality of health services.  Health workers are slow to implement new '\", \"b'service delivery and treatment protocols. Too often, health workers lack the training or tools to '\", \"b'provide quality care. This situation results in outdated procedures being used and poor service '\", \"b'standards.  Additionally, the lack of appropriate and properly maintained equipment, stable access '\", \"b'to electricity, and safe and hygienic working conditions, undermines the quality of the services '\", \"b'delivered at health facilities. The PNDS states that of the total 1,383 public health facilities in '\", 'b\"Guinea, half do not satisfy the MOH\\'s minimal physical structure standards. Also, the MOH reports \"', \"b'only 16 percent of facilities possess all the equipment it recommends.  '\", \"b'It is also estimated that only nine percent of these facilities have potable water and three percent '\", \"b'have electricity, a critical impediment to quality service delivery. It is also rare to find usable '\", \"b'latrines, food services and an acceptable system for the disposal of bio-medical wastes. There is '\", \"b'also a huge deficit in hospital beds. Guinea has one bed per 3,396 inhabitants whereas the WHO '\", \"b'recommends one bed per 1,000 inhabitants. '\", \"b'Furthermore, most (at least 50 percent) rural Guineans do not have access to health facilities '\", \"b'because they reside too far (five kilometers or more) from a health facility. The poor state of roads '\", \"b'also makes it difficult to reach health facilities, even if transport is available and can be afforded. '\", \"b'These barriers to accessing formal health facilities often cause people to consult local traditional '\", \"b'healers. By strengthening accessibility and quality of the community health system, GLHSS will '\", \"b'reduce this constraint and thus more people will be reached with quality health care. '\", \"b'Response: GLHSS will contribute to improved technical coordination among the various '\", \"b'levels of the health system and with donors, CSOs, FBOs and private sector partners. This '\", \"b'approach should help address issues related to uneven donor-provided service distribution. '\", \"b'As donors and MOH authorities are more attuned to each other\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s needs and constraints, '\", \"b'donors will be in a better position to fill existing gaps in health service delivery and avoid '\", \"b'programmatic duplication.  '\", \"b'Experience in Guinea and worldwide has demonstrated that introducing health service '\", \"b'financing mechanisms can alleviate the direct cost burden on patients and, in the case of '\", \"b'performance-based financing, can improve the quality of the services provided at health '\", \"b'14 '\", \"b'facilities. GLHSS will advocate, as appropriate and possible, health financing mechanisms '\", \"b'such as vouchers, community health insurance, and/or savings schemes.  '\", \"b'Building on the experience and lessons learned from the previous seven-year HSD project and over '\", \"b'ten years of PMI implementation, GLHSS will explore opportunities to partner with the private '\", \"b'sector (for- and not-for-profit entities), local authorities, CBOs and FBOs to address the '\", \"b'infrastructure, electrical, sanitation and equipment needs of health facilities. With an eye towards '\", \"b'fostering local health system self-reliance, GLHSS could include, as appropriate, equipment or '\", \"b'infrastructure support as an incentive for improving health facility performance.  '\", \"b'Important strategies to increase accessibility to affordable, quality care include a highly motivated '\", \"b'and well-trained health workforce, including community health workers, and mobile outreach '\", \"b'which brings services from the health facility directly to remote communities.  Both of these '\", \"b'strategies will be supported by GHLSS to facilitate quality service delivery.  GHLSS service '\", \"b'delivery efforts will focus on the technical areas of malaria, family planning, and maternal and child '\", \"b'health.  In addition, if necessary and permissible with available funding streams, GHLSS will '\", \"b'support COVID-related services and will be responsive to emerging pandemic threats and other '\", \"b'shocks. '\", \"b'Challenge 2: Supply Chain Management '\", \"b'The supply chain system for essential medicines and commodities is plagued by poor planning, '\", \"b'distribution, and stock management which leads to over or under stocking and wastage. The '\", \"b'system for procuring and distributing essential medicines requires increased coordination and '\", \"b'efficiency. Different donor and private sector procurement systems make it difficult to track '\", \"b'the quantity, type and destination of drugs in Guinea.  '\", \"b'Budgets for the procurement of essential medicines (both donor and government funded) are '\", \"b'often non-transparent and commodity procurement is not based on reliable consumption '\", \"b'information. Important logistical challenges (e.g., lack of roads and transportation, inadequate '\", \"b'storage conditions, shortage of fuel and electricity to maintain cold chains for vaccines) reduce '\", \"b'the availability of quality health commodities. According to a June 2018 audit report produced '\", \"b'by GAVI (The Vaccine Alliance), an appropriate vaccine management procedure did not exist '\", \"b'at Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s national storage warehouse. Moreover, data omissions and errors in inventory '\", \"b'management records contributed to the expiration of vaccine doses provided by GAVI. '\", \"b'Response: GLHSS will be the main operational arm of USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s overall approach '\", \"b'to strengthening commodity management at the health district level and below (health '\", \"b'centers, health posts, and Community Health Workers). At this level, GLHSS will engage '\", \"b'provincial and health facility managers in its targeted geographical zones in the management '\", \"b'of these commodities as stipulated by national protocols. GLHSS will not introduce new '\", \"b'tools, but will provide, as needed, training to concerned male and female health facility staff, '\", \"b'making sure they use existing tools in an appropriate and transparent manner. GLHSS will '\", \"b'facilitate the identification and implementation of sustainable solutions with local actors '\", \"b'(mosques, churches, CSOs, FBOs, private businesses, community-based organizations '\", \"b'(CBOs) and local leaders).  In addition, stipends paid by USAID and other entities to CHWs '\", \"b'15 '\", \"b'facilitate delivery of commodities to the last mile, as CHWs use these stipends to travel to '\", \"b'monthly health meetings where they submit data and replenish commodities. Reducing '\", \"b'reliance on donors for these stipends will be an important goal over the life of GLHSS and a '\", \"b'topic of co-engagement. '\", \"b'At the national level, the pharmaceutical procurement, storage and distribution agency of '\", \"b'Guinea, Pharmacie Centrale de Guin\\\\xc3\\\\xa9e (PCG), is responsible for importing and delivering to '\", \"b'all public health facilities at all levels in Guinea the medicines and medical equipment they '\", \"b'need to function efficiently. Recent reforms in PCG operations and the issuance in August '\", \"b'2020 of its new legal statutes offer the promise of improvements in the timely delivery to all '\", \"b'points within Guinea of essential drugs and medical equipment. '\", \"b'USAID support to the PCG and the MOH will continue under the Global Health Supply '\", \"b'Chain Program-Procurement and Supply Management (GHSC-PSM) project. PSM will '\", \"b'continue to manage the bulk procurement and distribution of USAID-funded malaria '\", \"b'commodities and family planning commodities. It is also envisioned that PSM will advocate '\", \"b'to ensure the procurement and delivery of essential medicines to the health facilities in the '\", \"b'geographic areas where GLHSS will be working. PSM will also be USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s main '\", \"b'interlocutor at the national level with the MOH and other donors to determine the best way '\", \"b'to harmonize existing supply chain systems in favor of strengthening the national supply '\", \"b'chain, including the PCG.  Since 2017, PSM has been assisting the MOH to develop a waste '\", \"b'management system for the disposal of damaged or expired medical products. PSM has also '\", \"b'worked since 2016 in collaboration with PMI to strengthen Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s supply chain for malaria '\", \"b'commodities. This effort has included the installation and use of a software program (eLMIS) '\", \"b'to improve logistical management of medical products.7      '\", \"b'In addition to coordinating with PSM, GLHSS will also coordinate with  another USAID '\", \"b'central buy-in mechanism, Promoting Quality of Medicines (PQM). PQM worked closely '\", \"b'with the MOH from 2014 to 2019 and its National Directorate of Pharmacy and Medicine '\", \"b'and National Medicines Quality Control Laboratory to strengthen their capacity to assure the '\", \"b'quality of medicines. PQM also supported MOH efforts to improve the overall regulation of '\", \"b'medicines and to build a quality control system for all essential medicines. The activities of '\", \"b'PQM, like PSM, are expected to be coordinated by GLHSS. '\", \"b'Challenge 3: Leadership, Management and Governance '\", \"b'Effective regulation, oversight and performance monitoring of the health workforce are '\", \"b'compromised by societal norms that encourage allegiances to social networks that guarantee '\", \"b'promotions to higher paying posts, rather than to clients, managers and supervisors. This lack '\", \"b'of accountability, combined with an arbitrary health facility fee-based system, and low to '\", \"b'non-existent government salaries, create opportunities for health sector workers to find '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cother means\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d for supporting themselves, which can translate into corrupt activities (e.g., '\", \"b'selling health commodities which are free and the addition of hidden costs to otherwise \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfree\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d '\", \"b'services).       '\", \"b'7 eLMIS = Electronic Logistics Management Information System '\", \"b'16 '\", \"b'Despite these shortcomings, past and current USAID experiences in Guinea have shown '\", \"b'there are competent, self-motivated personnel at all levels of Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health system. '\", \"b'They are often hampered by the lack of resources, as well as practical, applied skills in '\", \"b'management, budgeting, planning and problem-solving. Another human resource constraint '\", \"b'is the centralized and unilateral nature of decision-making at the top levels of the MOH.  '\", \"b'In terms of overarching governance documents (e.g., regulatory guidelines and frameworks), '\", \"b'the MOH does have a comprehensive list of appropriate and internationally recognized '\", \"b'policies, strategies and protocols. A challenge for GLHSS will be the effective '\", \"b'implementation of these plans and strategies at the local level. Much will depend on the '\", \"b'effectiveness of the decentralization process and the active participation of stakeholders.  '\", \"b'Response: GLHSS will work with health sector authorities and service providers to reinforce '\", \"b'their leadership and management skills, as well as accountability to their main stakeholders '\", \"b'and key clients. USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health office will work in concert with the Mission\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'Democracy and Governance (D/G) Office to improve stakeholder involvement in health '\", \"b'services management at the level of targeted communities and health facilities. The joint '\", \"b'efforts of these two USAID/Guinea offices will improve citizen oversight of service fees '\", \"b'collected and the quality of services provided at health facilities. '\", \"b'GLHSS will also support MOH efforts to implement its decentralization agenda via its '\", \"b'Community Health Strategic Plan. GLHSS will work closely with prefectural MOH health '\", \"b'officials to gain their support in its targeted geographic areas to ensure the successful '\", \"b'implementation of the health care decentralization process. GLHSS assistance in this area '\", \"b'could include material, logistical, and technical assistance to enable local health authorities '\", \"b'to improve their coverage in zones where USAID is working.

'\", \"b'Challenge 4: Human Resources for Health '\", \"b'In general, Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health workforce is ill-adapted to the needs of the population (i.e., too many '\", \"b'of the wrong type of providers based on population need), inadequately paid, poorly trained and  '\", \"b'motivated, and inequitably distributed. Recognizing that health worker salaries are low, there is a '\", \"b'temptation to provide salary supplements to individual health workers under the guise of '\", \"b'performance-based financing in order to achieve program objectives (e.g., increases in '\", \"b'immunization coverage, supervision visits and training sessions). There is a consensus among '\", \"b'health donors and MOH officials that this practice of providing salary supplements creates perverse '\", \"b'incentives, compromising the vision the MOH has for the health system.  '\", \"b'17 '\", \"b'A huge challenge to providing quality health care in Guinea is that the vast majority of trained '\", \"b'health care professionals reside in the capital city, Conakry. According to the MOH\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s PNDS, over '\", \"b'50 percent of its employees live and work in Conakry. Another estimated 15 percent are based in '\", \"b'two regions, Kindia and Mamou. Therefore, about 35 percent (approx. 4,200) of the total of about '\", \"b'12,000 health care professional MOH employees are spread thinly over Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s remaining six '\", \"b'administrative regions.  '\", \"b'This inequitable distribution of MOH health personnel results in critical shortages of health '\", \"b'professionals in rural areas. These shortages are exacerbated by limited training, low employee '\", \"b'retention rates and an insufficient capacity to manage efficiently MOH human resources. The '\", \"b'overall poor performance of health personnel discourages the local population and undermines trust '\", \"b'in the quality of services provided by their local health facility.  '\", \"b'A glaring observation is that there are insufficient women in Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health workforce. Women '\", \"b'serve as nurses, midwives and traditional birth attendants, but there are few women working as '\", \"b'health facility managers. Also, there are few women medical doctors, particularly in rural areas. '\", \"b'The latter may be due to the MOH taking gender into consideration when assigning health personnel '\", \"b'(e.g., married women prefer working in urban areas so they can be near their families). '\", \"b'Response: Motivated Community Health Workers are critical to accessible, quality services '\", \"b'at community level and therefore key to the success of GHLSS.  GHLSS will provide '\", \"b'technical assistance to propose sustainable solutions to advance the national Community '\", \"b'Health Strategy.  GHLSS will incentivize progressive local contributions to the financing of '\", \"b'CHWs while providing limited stipends to CHWs in targeted regions as needed to ensure '\", \"b'continuity of community services.  USAID and the U.S. Embassy will continue to advocate '\", \"b'for the full and timely payment of CHWs and other health cadres by the GoG.  GLHSS and '\", \"b'the entire USAID/Guinea Mission will support other donor efforts to rationalize health '\", \"b'worker registries (e.g., identifying actual versus ghost workers) to enable the MOH to better '\", \"b'comprehend the current status of its workforce.  '\", \"b'At the regional, prefectural, district and community levels, GLHSS will improve technical '\", \"b'and managerial skills, and raise the motivation of the health workforce. GLHSS will provide '\", \"b'technical assistance and training support at the health district and community levels to '\", \"b'reinforce the technical skills of community health workers and facility managers. GLHSS '\", \"b'will also work to strengthen the administrative capacities of local health authorities. In '\", \"b'addition to improving needed skills, non-material incentives such as training will help '\", \"b'motivate workers to improve health service delivery and management.  '\", \"b'GLHSS will work with health service providers and communities to identify other means of '\", \"b'motivating health workers, paying attention to the different motivating factors for male and '\", \"b'female health workers as well as youth. These means may include improving the physical '\", \"b'working environment and introducing quality incentives. In the absence of direct salary '\", \"b'payments, these activities will contribute to the body of knowledge on what factors motivate '\", \"b'health workers. It would also be useful to examine what incentives health professionals based '\", \"b'in Conakry need to work at other locations in Guinea.  '\", \"b'18 '\", \"b'Challenge 5: Health Information Systems '\", \"b'The current MOH systems to collect, enter, analyze and report health-related information are '\", \"b'fragmented, impeding evidence-based decision-making. Nationally standardized tools for '\", \"b'health data collection, analysis and transmission are not well disseminated. Donor and '\", \"b'national disease-specific program priorities produce multiple data collection tools that result '\", \"b'in duplicative data collection efforts. Data from private health facilities are not captured. '\", \"b'Health center staff can spend approximately half of their time collecting and reporting data, '\", \"b'thus reducing the amount of time they have to provide health care. '\", \"b'In 2016, USAID/Guinea assisted the MOH to begin the adoption of the DHIS2 software '\", \"b'system to collect, analyze and report on pertinent health data.8 Thus far, data recorded in '\", \"b'DHIS2 cover HIV, infectious diseases, maternal and child health, child immunization, '\", \"b'disease surveillance, service delivery, and a comprehensive listing of health facilities. Health '\", \"b'workers in all national, regional and district hospitals have been trained in the use of DHIS2. '\", \"b'The use of DHIS2 is being expanded to the health center level and some health centers have '\", \"b'tried to use DHIS2, but, generally, health centers depend on monthly paper records and do '\", \"b'little, if any, analysis of the data collected. Generally, there is rarely feedback from the central '\", \"b'level about data submitted by health centers; consequently, quality control of data is lacking, '\", \"b'and health districts seldom use the data collected to make decisions.  Moreover, PMI is using '\", \"b'DHIS2 to collect digital data pertinent to malaria at the community level. '\", \"b'Response:  GLHSS will support the expansion of the use of DHIS2 to health centers in its '\", \"b'geographic focus areas. At the same time, GLHSS will work to rationalize the current system '\", \"b'of data collection and analysis at the regional and prefectural health levels. GLHSS will work '\", \"b'closely with local health facility staff and higher-level health managers to strengthen routine '\", \"b'data collection, analysis and reporting, ensuring that data entered is sex-disaggregated and '\", \"b'of good quality. GLHSS will also champion the elimination of data collection tools still in '\", \"b'use that duplicate the DHIS2 system. Overall, GLHSS will work to ensure that DHIS2 is '\", \"b'recognized nationally and used correctly at all health facilities, including the private sector '\", \"b'and non-public health facilities. In addition, GLHSS will support the use of eLMIS for '\", \"b'reporting and data analysis in its geographic zones. '\", \"b'Challenge 6: Social and Behavior Change (SBC) '\", \"b'Traditional gender, cultural, and societal norms perpetuate harmful practices which '\", \"b'prevent individuals, including service providers, from adopting health-promoting '\", \"b'behaviors. Other best practices related to education, civic participation and good '\", \"b'governance are also constrained by these practices. Current and past SBC interventions '\", \"b'have neither systematically analyzed nor addressed the key determinants of the harmful '\", \"b'gender, cultural and societal norms that underlie these practices, influencing negative '\", \"b'health outcomes. Therefore, innovation is needed to guide future SBC efforts.  '\", \"b'8 DHIS2 = District Health Information System, version 2 '\", \"b'19 '\", \"b'More research is needed to clarify the determinants of desired health behavior change '\", \"b'within the larger societal context, including exploring deeply issues affecting gender and '\", \"b'youth. A special focus will be on the power dynamics at play at the community level and '\", \"b'the incentives that drive negative behaviors which hinder the delivery and management '\", \"b'of quality health services.  '\", \"b'Communication channels (e.g., mass media, interpersonal and group discussions) are '\", \"b'under-utilized and, when used, they are not used effectively. For example, Community '\", \"b'Health Workers (CHWs) who are responsible for disseminating key health messages in '\", \"b'rural areas lack materials to raise the awareness of their communities about negative and '\", \"b'positive health behaviors and practices. CHWs need to be able to motivate communities '\", \"b'to adopt healthy behaviors. Moreover, there is a multiplicity of health information, '\", \"b'education and communication materials of varying quality and utility that often do not '\", \"b'reflect adequately gender and youth issues, the local culture, or the linguistic and societal '\", \"b'context. '\", \"b'Response: '\", \"b'Culturally '\", \"b'appropriate '\", \"b'SBC '\", \"b'activities, '\", \"b'delivered '\", \"b'through '\", \"b'effective '\", \"b'communications channels that use materials relevant to the local situation and context are '\", \"b'essential to increasing knowledge and shifting social norms and individual attitudes. SBC '\", \"b'communications (SBCC) will be an important complement to activities designed to achieve '\", \"b'general societal behavior change. New SBC research will be undertaken in GLHSS\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 target '\", \"b'zones to identify the cultural realities, social norms, and general attitudes and beliefs that '\", \"b'need to be changed to achieve favorable health outcomes. The results of this research will '\", \"b'provide SBC activities and communication campaigns with the information they need to '\", \"b'develop high impact programs that result in the positive changes in behavior which improve '\", \"b'the health profile of Guineans. '\", \"b'GLHSS will also help develop innovative national health communication approaches, '\", \"b'strategies and standardized messages, including where appropriate, for mass campaigns (e.g., '\", \"b'national immunization days, mosquito bed net distribution and disease awareness '\", \"b'campaigns). GLHSS will take steps to ensure that all health practice demonstrations and '\", \"b'messages are adapted to the local context. GLHSS will also support beneficial community-'\", \"b'level and interpersonal health communication activities.  '\", \"b'At the same time, GLHSS will undertake activities with health care providers to address any '\", \"b'negative beliefs and biases they may possess as well as gaps in their knowledge with regards '\", \"b'to improved health-enhancing behaviors. The aim will be to make health care workers '\", \"b'influential examples of healthy behaviors to be adopted by the general population. GLHSS '\", \"b'will also endeavor to ensure that the MOH has the capacity to implement effectively '\", \"b'nationwide a training program on health-enhancing behaviors for all concerned health care '\", \"b'professionals, men and women, as well as traditional authorities, birth attendants and '\", \"b'religious leaders.  '\", \"b'As a part of its SBC operational research agenda, GLHSS will contribute to the design and '\", \"b'testing of a mix of proven and innovative approaches to address the behavior change '\", \"b'challenges facing its targeted populations. Emphasis will be placed on changing negative '\", \"b'20 '\", \"b'behaviors that affect the reduction of maternal and child under-five mortality (e.g., family '\", \"b'planning, exclusive breastfeeding, FGM/C). The interactions between cultural norms and '\", \"b'service provider behavior, including appropriate counseling and service delivery practices, '\", \"b'will also be examined as part of this SBC exercise. '\", \"b'This subject will be among the special topics to be explored in-depth by prospective '\", \"b'applicants, USAID/Guinea, and concerned stakeholders during the implementation of '\", \"b'GLHSS as part of an ongoing co-engagement process. This subject includes appraising '\", \"b'the capacity of the MOH to design and conduct effective national SBC campaigns.  '\", \"b'Challenge 7: Funding for the Health Sector '\", \"b'One main reason that Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health system does not function well is because of the insufficiency '\", \"b'of financial resources at every level. It is estimated that only up to eight percent of the GOG\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'national budget is for its health sector, although it was recommended at a conference of African '\", \"b'heads of state in Abuja, Nigeria in 2001 that a minimum of 15 percent of national budgets be '\", \"b'devoted to each country\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s respective health sectors. (Referred to as the Abuja Declaration.) In '\", \"b'Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s case, the actual amount of funding disbursed annually by the MOH is much lower than '\", \"b'the amount of its annual budget.  '\", \"b'The lengthy MOH integrated operational action plan (PAO) issued in January 2020 reported that '\", \"b'the MOH only disbursed 37 percent of its planned annual budget for 2019 of over 239.5 billion '\", \"b'Guinean Francs (GNF), equaling in U.S. Dollars (USD) about $25 million.9 It is estimated that '\", \"b'about 27 percent of total national expenditures on health is provided by the MOH. It is also '\", \"b'estimated that the USD value of donor contributions to Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health sector was higher in 2019 '\", \"b'than the actual budget amount disbursed by the MOH. '\", \"b'Guinea has one of the lowest per capita health expenditures in the world. It was estimated in 2016 '\", \"b'that Guinea spent about $34 per capita on health expenditures. This compares to $31 and $66 spent '\", \"b'per capita, respectively, in the neighboring countries of Mali and Sierra Leone. In this regard, '\", \"b'Guinea is well below the Sub-Saharan Africa country average of $83 spent per capita on health-'\", \"b'related expenditures.10 '\", \"b'Without sufficient financial resources, it is difficult to train, staff and pay sufficiently well-qualified '\", \"b'staff at Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health facilities at every level. Thus, the number of trained health professionals '\", \"b'working in Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health system is greatly inferior to the recommended level. This lack of '\", \"b'funding also means that much of the health infrastructure is in a poor state and under-equipped. As '\", \"b'noted earlier, this includes the absence of clean water and latrines, and electricity (thus no Internet) '\", \"b'in many health facilities. The misuse of funding received at all levels is common. There is a lack of '\", \"b'competent leadership, accountability and transparency at every level of Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health system.

In addition, '\", \"b'USAID/Guinea will also urge the MOH to increase its capacity to fully disburse and use efficiently '\", \"b'its annual budget.  '\", \"b'USAID/Guinea will also collaborate with other donors to discuss frankly with the MOH any gross '\", \"b'misuse of GOG funding budgeted for the health sector and urge the MOH to take corrective actions.

'\", \"b'Furthermore, GLHSS will advocate in its target geographic zones for funds provided to local '\", \"b'government entities to be used to improve health facility infrastructure.

'\", \"b'A.7 '\", \"b'Lessons Learned '\", \"b'The main lesson learned from the evaluation of the first five-years (2015-2020) of USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'flagship HSD project was that increased impact could be achieved by decreasing the breadth and '\", \"b'increasing the depth of any follow-on project. This is one reason USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health team '\", \"b'decided to reduce the new activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s geographic coverage from the seven regions covered by the '\", \"b'previous HSD project to three regions and five Conakry communes covered by PMI. This reduction '\", \"b'in geographic focus will allow for a more in-depth and impactful approach as well as greater '\", \"b'consolidation with the PMI program. At the same time, efforts will be intensified under GLHSS to '\", \"b'reach more deeply into communities and related health facilities.  '\", \"b'Following recommendations of the HSD evaluation, GLHSS will therefore focus its efforts on '\", \"b'fewer regions in order to achieve the aims of its assistance to Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s health sector. Previously, '\", \"b'by stretching its resources to cover a larger geographic territory, desired results were not achieved. '\", \"b'22 '\", \"b'Consequently, by concentrating resources on fewer regions and increased consolidation with PMI, '\", \"b'GLHSS is expected to achieve a higher level of results.  '\", \"b'Accordingly, under GLHSS, the regions of Faranah, Kankan and Mamou will not be covered. The '\", \"b'MOH and other donors (e.g., the Global Fund, World Bank, EU, UN agencies (UNICEF, WHO, '\", \"b'UNFPA, etc) will continue their health coverage of these regions. It is important to note that '\", \"b'USAID/Guinea will work closely with HSD, other donors, and the MOH in the final year of HSD '\", \"b'to facilitate a smooth transition. '\", \"b'It is believed that this integration of PMI activities with maternal/child health (MCH) and family '\", \"b'planning/reproductive health (FP/RH) will result in greater impact at the community level and allow '\", \"b'for a more holistic approach '\", \"b'Estimated core funding level by health area, subject to availability of funds: '\", \"b'Family planning  '\", \"b'20% '\", \"b'Maternal and child health '\", \"b'25% '\", \"b'Infectious disease (malaria and possibly COVID)  '\", \"b'55% '\", \"b'It is also believed this geographic realignment will strengthen the PMI program as it coincides with '\", \"b'those regions and Conakry communes covered by this program. Basically, under GLHSS previous '\", \"b'assistance in the areas of MCH and FP/RH in the regions of Faranah, Kankan and Mamou will '\", \"b'instead be focused on those regions and communes covered by the PMI program. This change in '\", \"b'geographic coverage is deemed necessary in order for USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s overall health program to '\", \"b'achieve lasting results.  '\", \"b'The HSD evaluation report also emphasized the need to support the MOH\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s national Community '\", \"b'Health Strategic Plan, as well as increased accountability, collaboration, leadership and ownership '\", \"b'at every level of the health system. This evaluation also highlighted the need to focus on critical '\", \"b'requirements (e.g., pre-service training and human resource management) of improving the quality '\", \"b'of health care delivery, particularly stressing the continuum of integrated care and the need for an '\", \"b'efficient referral system. In addition, this evaluation recommended exercising flexibility in the '\", \"b'design and implementation of a new activity so that activities can adapt readily to changing contexts '\", \"b'and needs and be responsive to evolving beneficiary needs and priorities. All the lessons learned in '\", \"b'the previous HSD project will be taken into account in the design of GLHSS. '\", \"b'Lessons have also been learned from the implementation of PMI (Stop-Palu+) which has been '\", \"b'active in Guinea since 2011. These lessons are of particular importance because as noted earlier '\", \"b'23 '\", \"b'malaria is endemic in all areas of Guinea and remains the number one health problem, particularly '\", \"b'for pregnant women and children under five years of age. As also noted previously, malaria is the '\", \"b'primary cause in Guinea of clinical consultations, hospitalizations and deaths. Obviously, reducing '\", \"b'the high incidence of malaria will relieve the health system of its biggest burden, as well as save '\", \"b'thousands of lives.  '\", \"b'Any USAID health program working in Guinea to roll back malaria is required to work closely '\", \"b'with the MOH\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s National Malaria Control Program (PNLP). The goal stated in the PNLP\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s National '\", \"b'Strategic Plan 2018-2022 is: Reduce Malaria Related Morbidity and Mortality by 75 percent from '\", \"b'the 2016 level, bringing Guinea to pre-elimination status by 2022. The implementation of this new '\", \"b'activity will require continued close collaboration with the PNLP and the demonstration of '\", \"b'economical but effective ways of reaching communities with malaria control activities.  '\", \"b'Perhaps the most valuable lesson learned by years of experience with the PMI program is the '\", \"b'constructive quality of its relationship with host country health personnel at every level. This quality '\", \"b'is especially evident in the collaboration exercised in the preparation of annual PMI operational '\", \"b'plans (MOPs). Also, PMI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s collaboration with the Global Fund to achieve a higher impact in terms '\", \"b'of reducing the incidence of malaria is another good practice. PMI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s efforts to have the PNLP take '\", \"b'clear ownership of Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s malaria control program is also worthy of note.  '\", \"b'The operational mechanism used by PMI in Guinea can well serve as a model to replicate in other '\", \"b'regions of Guinea, particularly with regard to its use of data systems and its conduct of a Monitoring '\", \"b'and Evaluation (M&E) system to plan and make decisions. The manner PMI is able to collaborate '\", \"b'with community health agents to collect data and diagnose and treat malaria is a good example of '\", \"b'how other health services can function at the community level. The regular meetings between PNLP '\", \"b'and PMI staff are instructive on how to share any lessons learned and apply them in practice.  '\", \"b'Closely associated with PMI are lessons learned by PSM\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work in Guinea since 2011 and PQM\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'activities in Guinea in the 2011 to 2019 period. PSM activities and experiences have contributed to '\", \"b'a better understanding of the PCG\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s procurement and supply chain mechanisms. The results of '\", \"b'PQM\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work in Guinea have highlighted the importance and challenges of installing an effective '\", \"b'quality assurance program for the control and use of essential medicines. '\", \"b'The lessons learned on how to cope productively with the COVID-19 pandemic are instructive. '\", \"b'Learning how to operate effectively from remote locations has been a revelation in terms of '\", \"b'maintaining an acceptable level of achievement in spite of the limitations caused by the pandemic. '\", \"b'A notable example of keeping the work moving in spite of the restrictions imposed by the pandemic '\", \"b'was the ability of in-country partners to modify protocols so that a nationwide Seasonal Malaria '\", \"b'Chemoprevention (SMC) program for young children could be conducted in 2020.  '\", \"b'While the 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic in Guinea was different from the COVID-19 pandemic in '\", \"b'terms of its mode of transmission, symptoms, lethality and geographic locations, it provides some '\", \"b'useful lessons, as does the Ebola outbreak in early 2021 in the Forest Region. Ebola was similar to '\", \"b'COVID-19 in that they both discourage the general populace from using public health facilities. '\", \"b'24 '\", \"b'The threat of a potential resurgence of Ebola and the current limitations imposed by the prolonged '\", \"b'COVID-19 pandemic contribute to a reduction in the use of health facilities.11 Like Ebola, the '\", \"b'COVID-19 pandemic also requires USAID/Guinea staff time, for example to provide personal '\", \"b'protective equipment to health facility staff, deliver COVID vaccine donations to the MOH.  '\", \"b'Activity Goal, Intermediate Results, Focus Areas and Performance Factors '\", \"b'Goal: Contribute to sustainable improvements in the health status of Guineans '\", \"b'The achievement of this goal will be measured by the following changes experienced by '\", \"b'communities and local health facilities supported by USAID: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Evidence of an improvement in governance practices of prefectural health authorities and '\", \"b'health service providers.

In view of the '\", \"b'many challenges facing public health facilities, the result of providing increased health care at the '\", \"b'community level will be an increase in the number of Guineans reached. GLHSS\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 community '\", \"b'approach also recognizes the ongoing decentralization process in Guinea that is moving to grant '\", \"b'greater decision-making power to the prefecture level, communes and community levels. GLHSS '\", \"b'will help strengthen this decentralization process.  It will facilitate consideration of health concerns '\", \"b'of communities in decentralized resource mobilization efforts and allocation decisions.  In addition, '\", \"b'it will give communities a greater say in the operations of their local health facility.  GHLSS will '\", \"b'apply a social and behavioral science lens to improve motivation and behavior of health workers, '\", \"b'local officials, and community members. '\", \"b'GLHSS supports the MOH and is integrated, responsive to beneficiary needs and priorities, '\", \"b'technically sound, and feasible. In many respects, it builds on the lessons learned of its predecessor '\", \"b'projects, HSD and StopPalu+, but with increased technical and financial efficiencies as an '\", \"b'integrated project GLHSS will build in its targeted geographic zones on the achievements of this '\", \"b'former health project. '\", \"b'The final evaluation of the previous project recommended narrowing the focus of any follow-on '\", \"b'project. Therefore, GLHSS will work in fewer geographic regions and concentrate on making health '\", \"b'services work efficiently for more people at the community level. The goal of augmented assistance '\", \"b'to improve health systems at the local level is to reinforce efforts to implement effectively the '\", \"b'MOH\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Community Health Strategic Plan.  '\", \"b'While GLHSS will focus on the decentralized level, achieving the results desired will depend on '\", \"b'maintaining existing, and forging new, strong and productive links between communities and their '\", \"b'local public health service facilities. Therefore, this bottom-up approach will entail strengthening '\", \"b'the functions and outreach capabilities of local public health facilities and, as appropriate and '\", \"b'needed, higher levels of the health system, including the prefectural, regional and national levels. '\", \"b'Community satisfaction with the improved performance of these links will help build needed trust '\", \"b'in the local health system.  '\", \"b'Important in building these links is the work of well-trained and -equipped CHWs and Community '\", \"b'Relays (RECOs). CHWs and RECOs are the cornerstones of this community health approach.16 '\", \"b'Well-performing and well-supported local health facilities, CHWs and RECOs will increase '\", \"b'community commitment to making the local health system work for them. Communities will '\", \"b'become more motivated and involved in efforts to mobilize their fellow citizens, men and women, '\", \"b'to undertake actions that improve their health conditions, including positive behavior changes and '\", \"b'the adoption of healthier practices. '\", \"b'16 CHW in French is Agent de Sant\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 Communautaire (ASC) and RECO in French is Relais Communautaire. '\", \"b'29 '\", \"b'Active community participation in the governance of the local health system is a necessary element '\", \"b'in creating a consistent, productive and sustainable health care system which benefits equitably all '\", \"b'concerned. By engaging communities more in the management of their health status, they become '\", \"b'more resilient and vocal in demanding the health services they need, and should receive, from the '\", \"b'GOG. This type of increased community participation supports the GOG\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s efforts to decentralize '\", \"b'governance. A major aim of GLHSS will be to increase the capacity of communities, especially '\", \"b'their health committees (e.g., Comit\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 de Sant\\\\xc3\\\\xa9 et d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Hygi\\\\xc3\\\\xa8ne \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 COSAH), to participate actively in '\", \"b'local health governance and the GOG\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s overall decentralization process. In this regard, the '\", \"b'Mission\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s D/G office will be of assistance.  '\", \"b'A main goal of GLHSS is to increase the number of beneficiaries reached with quality health care. '\", \"b'As noted earlier, it is believed that greater numbers of people will be reached through this '\", \"b'community approach. This increase in beneficiaries will reduce the cost per beneficiary and, '\", \"b'consequently, lend itself to the sustainability of activities supported by GLHSS. The practice of '\", \"b'cost efficiencies in the implementation of GLHSS will be applied. Attention will be exercised to '\", \"b'not introduce recurrent costs that would be difficult to sustain by local and central government '\", \"b'bodies after the end of GLHSS. '\", \"b'Coordination with and leveraging of other USG and donor efforts is an important hallmark of this '\", \"b'activity.  For example, USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s economic growth office is designing a Global Development '\", \"b'Alliance (GDA) award that would support electrification of health facilities.  GHLSS will '\", \"b'coordinate with this activity, for example, leveraging electrification as an incentive to motivate and '\", \"b'reward high-performing facilities and their staff.

'\", \"b'A.11 USAID Guiding Principles  '\", \"b'Sustainability. A key USAID priority is the ability of a country to solve its own development '\", \"b'challenges. The overall purpose of GLHSS is to increase Guineans\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ability to plan, finance and '\", \"b'manage their health system and their own health. All of the activities and interventions must be '\", \"b'designed with this in mind. GLHSS will be designed to build sustainability and help Guinean '\", \"b'communities, households, and individuals become more self-reliant in the management of their '\", \"b'own health. It will help targeted communities be able to better manage their own finances for '\", \"b'health, and help communities hold health workers and local government officials accountable for '\", \"b'the availability and quality of health services. A key to GLHSS\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s success will be the sustainable '\", \"b'adoption of healthy behaviors and practices so that intensive external engagement is no longer '\", \"b'needed in the future.   '\", \"b'Collaborative Learning and Adaptive Management (CLAM) refers to incorporating an iterative '\", \"b'learning process by undertaking on a regular basis analysis and the adaptation of best practices to '\", \"b'the activity design in the local context. CLAM facilitates shock-responsive, adaptive '\", \"b'programming and maximizes the attainment of the greatest impact. Establishing implementation '\", \"b'decision points and milestones will be necessary during the life of GLHSS. '\", \"b'Engagement of Local Actors. Guinea has a rich social system and structure that plays a critical '\", \"b'role in influencing key decisions that impact behaviors and the overall performance of the health '\", \"b'system. Partnerships with local communities, schools and academic institutions, health '\", \"b'care organizations, public and private providers, and professional societies, as well as faith-based, '\", \"b'non-governmental, and civil society organizations, will be essential to the success of GLHSS. '\", \"b'Private Sector Engagement. USAID is committed to partnering with the private sector. Strategic '\", \"b'and proactive engagement of the private sector improves the identification and definition of '\", \"b'critical economic and social development problems; strengthens the design and implementation '\", \"b'of promising solutions to those problems; and increases the sustainable impact of investments in '\", \"b'developing countries. Therefore, Applicants are encouraged to explore partnering opportunities '\", \"b'with the private sector through strategic and ongoing collaboration in order to increase the impact, '\", \"b'reach, efficiency and effectiveness of GLHSS.   '\", \"b'Conflict Sensitivity. All activities will be designed to take into account the security context of the '\", \"b'regions, districts, and communities in which they will be implemented, and will be flexible '\", \"b'enough to change if implementation in certain zones becomes impossible for security reasons. All '\", \"b'activities will also be designed with a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cconflict-sensitive lens\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d to ensure that nothing exacerbates '\", \"b'existing conflicts. Women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s empowerment and positive youth development are key approaches, '\", \"b'33 '\", \"b'including the intentional engagement of women and youth in the whole range of decision-making '\", \"b'actions that affects their lives.   '\", \"b'Resilience. For USAID, resilience is the ability of people, households, communities, countries, '\", \"b'and systems to mitigate, adapt to, and recover from shocks and stresses in a manner that reduces '\", \"b'chronic vulnerability and facilitates inclusive growth. USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s resiliency guidance focuses '\", \"b'specifically on areas where chronic poverty intersects with shocks, disease outbreaks and stresses '\", \"b'to produce recurrent crises and undermine development gains. As appropriate, GLHSS is '\", \"b'expected to:   '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Proactively seek opportunities for joint programming that amplifies results.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Describe joint interventions in annual work plans that clarify roles and responsibilities '\", \"b'around specific programmatic linkages with other humanitarian activities. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Conduct joint site visits with other humanitarian partners, when appropriate, to '\", \"b'facilitate learning across activities.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Actively participate in USAID partner meetings and learning events, including hosting '\", \"b'those meetings when needed.   '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Contribute to joint indicators linked to USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s CDCS results framework, analysis, '\", \"b'and the diffusion of reliable information in collaboration with other USAID reporting '\", \"b'systems and those, as appropriate, of other donors; and  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Respond to information requests and taskers coming from USAID.  '\", \"b'Gender Equality and Social Inclusion. Gender issues are central to the achievement of '\", \"b'USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s development objectives. Gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) are a mandatory '\", \"b'consideration for all USAID programming. It aims at ensuring that both men and women have '\", \"b'equal opportunity to benefit from and contribute to economic, social, cultural and political '\", \"b'development; enjoy socially valued resources and rewards; and realize their human rights.   '\", \"b'In Guinea, there is a high and pervasive disparity in health outcomes caused by factors such as '\", \"b'gender, wealth, ethnicity, disability, and geographic location. Applicants will need to strongly '\", \"b'consider GESI issues when designing their technical approach and analyze the key exclusion '\", \"b'issues in service delivery and how they will be minimized and monitored so that improved health '\", \"b'outcomes will be achieved. Applicants are required to explicitly ask how gender issues such as '\", \"b'identifying and understanding the causes of gender inequalities; differences in roles, '\", \"b'responsibilities, and needs of men and women; and the relationships between men and women, '\", \"b'within the same sex, and between older and younger men and women are linked to health care '\", \"b'utilization.  '\", \"b'Applicants must therefore integrate gender issues into all program components. Likewise, '\", \"b'Applicants must articulate how GLHSS activities will ensure equal opportunities for historically '\", \"b'marginalized populations in Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s diverse society.

'\", \"b'Inclusive Development. USAID is committed to the inclusion of people who have physical and '\", \"b'cognitive disabilities in line with the USAID Disability Policy. The objectives of the USAID '\", \"b'34 '\", \"b'Disability Policy are (1) to enhance the attainment of United States foreign assistance program '\", \"b'goals by promoting the participation and equalization of opportunities of individuals with '\", \"b'disabilities in USAID policy, country and sector strategies, activity designs and implementation; '\", \"b'(2) to increase awareness of issues of people with disabilities both within USAID programs and '\", \"b'in host countries; and (3) to engage disabled people the maximum extent possible. '\", \"b'Flexibility. The design of GLHSS will allow for flexibility should the security situation or '\", \"b'outbreaks arise that prevent the implementation of activities in certain areas. '\", \"b'Tailored, Evidence-Based Interventions. The social and cultural contexts of Guinea vary, as '\", \"b'should approaches and interventions designed for different regions. Evidence-based and tailored '\", \"b'SBC strategies will focus on achieving measurable changes in jointly identified priority behaviors '\", \"b'with the highest potential to improve health, self-reliance, and resiliency outcomes and accelerate '\", \"b'the prevention of child and maternal deaths. All interventions will also promote equitable gender '\", \"b'norms, including shared decision-making within the household and active women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s participation '\", \"b'in community management and oversight of health services quality and systems functioning. '\", \"b'Design and delivery of interventions should increase the capacity of community members and '\", \"b'community structures to develop and implement their own evidence-based health strategies '\", \"b'that are tailored to their contexts.   '\", \"b'Collaboration Within and Across Sectors. Collaboration and coordination are critical to ensure '\", \"b'maximum impact. The recipient is expected to collaborate closely and create synergies with other '\", \"b'development partners implementing at the local level in the geographic areas covered. These '\", \"b'partnerships include the following: required coordination with all partners operating in '\", \"b'USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s designated prefectures, districts and communities, including coordination with '\", \"b'other USAID supported interventions in other sectors, such as governance and other donors and '\", \"b'actors in the health sector. Interventions should also be complementary. '\", \"b'Patient-Centered Approach: All activities related to the delivery of health services should use a '\", \"b'patient-centered approach, consisting of enabling patients to exercise their rights and fulfill '\", \"b'their responsibilities with transparency, respect and dignity, by giving due consideration to their '\", \"b'values and needs. Patient-centered care treats the patient as a partner instead of just a recipient, '\", \"b'empowering patients and providers and allowing for empowered individuals.   '\", \"b'A.12 Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning  '\", \"b'Of critical importance will be the elaboration of a strong and comprehensive Activity Monitoring, '\", \"b'Evaluation and Learning Plan (AMELP) to track implementation progress, or lack thereof, towards '\", \"b'the achievement of its stated results. Thus, the selected implementation agent must have a clear '\", \"b'description of each key action and how they contribute to the achievement of the activity goal and, '\", \"b'hence, USAID/Guinea\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s DO 1. The Applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s AMELP must require the establishment of a '\", \"b'baseline of data and information upon which progress toward achieving results can be measured. '\", \"b'This plan will entail a continuous process of systematic monitoring so that implementation '\", \"b'interventions can be modified as needed to ensure maximum impact. '\", \"b'35 '\", \"b'The AMELP will also include a clear depiction of how the activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s key performance indicators '\", \"b'will be tracked and the schedule for mid-term and final evaluations. This plan will be in '\", \"b'conformance with USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Evaluation Policy. In particular, all planned evaluations will have a set '\", \"b'of questions that will be communicated in advance to USAID/Guinea. The answers to these key '\", \"b'questions will serve to alert USAID/Guinea to any problems the implementation agent is '\", \"b'experiencing. The answers will also serve to forecast the level of success of GLHSS. '\", \"b'USAID/Guinea expects to learn from the information generated from the implementation agent\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'AMELP important lessons that it can use in the design of future similar activities. This information '\", \"b'will also be used by USAID/Guinea to engage stakeholders from the MOH, other concerned donors '\", \"b'and community beneficiaries. The steadfast and efficient execution of the AMELP is also expected '\", \"b'to identify success stories worthy of wide dissemination by USAID.     '\", \"b'USAID/Guinea may commission one or more independent evaluations. The GLHSS grant recipient '\", \"b'will be expected to provide inputs as requested by USAID/Guinea to the evaluation team '\", \"b'conducting this external evaluation.

'\", \"b'1. Background '\", \"b'The world still needs an HIV vaccine to sustainably control the HIV pandemic. Despite the '\", \"b'significant progress to combat HIV and achieve epidemic control, the most recent UNAIDS global '\", \"b'analysis estimates that 1.5 million people became newly infected in 2021, with almost two-thirds '\", \"b'of these new infections occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Women and girls accounted for '\", \"b'50% of these new infections globally, and 63% of all new infections in SSA, where there are twice '\", \"b'as many young women as men ages 15-24 already living with HIV. While new biomedical tools, '\", \"b'such as pre-exposure prophylaxis, offer promise for continuing to reduce HIV incidence, a safe and '\", \"b'effective preventive HIV vaccine could enable a much more profound, rapid, and cost-effective '\", \"b'reduction than would be possible by employing only already existing interventions. Since most new '\", \"b'infections are occurring in SSA, it is critical that HIV vaccine candidates are designed to effectively '\", \"b'neutralize viruses that are circulating in this region.     '\", \"b'Recent studies suggest that an HIV vaccine can be effective if it generates robust broadly '\", \"b'neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which can block a variety of HIV strains. However, traditional '\", \"b'approaches to vaccination have yet to induce bNAbs effectively. The HIV vaccine research field is; '\", \"b'therefore, focusing on using a variety of groundbreaking approaches to develop innovative vaccine '\", \"b'candidates that have been rationally designed to stimulate the human immune system to produce '\", \"b'bNAbs along with complementary T cell responses. Over the next decade, there will be a need to '\", \"b'conduct many small-scale trials to test new HIV vaccine immunogens in SSA, iteratively improving '\", \"b'them until they generate high enough titers of bNAbs that would justify testing them in larger-scale '\", \"b'efficacy trials.  '\", \"b'For this long-term effort to be sustainable, cost-effective, and equitable, it is critical that scientists '\", \"b'and institutions in SSA countries with persistently high HIV incidence play a leading role in '\", \"b'designing and testing vaccine candidates while developing an in-depth understanding of relevant '\", \"b'immune responses in SSA populations. While many centers within SSA now have the advanced '\", \"b'laboratory and clinical research capabilities to lead future vaccine research, very little global HIV '\", \"b'vaccine R&D funding has gone directly to SSA prime organizations. Operating as subpartners, SSA '\", \"b'organizations have often been limited to receiving finalized protocols, testing candidate vaccines, '\", \"b'and shipping samples outside of the country to others. Supportive mechanisms are needed to '\", \"b'provide greater opportunities for the SSA scientific talent that currently exists to be fully utilized, '\", \"b'laying the groundwork for sub-Saharan African ownership and leadership toward HIV vaccine '\", \"b'discovery. '\", \"b'2. Objective  '\", \"b'The objective of the HIV-VISTA Project is to support sub-Saharan African scientists, institutions, '\", \"b'and innovative systems of collaboration in designing and testing improved HIV vaccine candidates '\", \"b'that will advance the field toward the long-term goal of a safe and globally-effective HIV vaccine.    '\", \"b'    Page 4 of 48 '\", \"b'NOFO #7200AA23RFA00002  '\", \"b'HIV Vaccine Innovation, Science, and Technology Acceleration in Africa (HIV-VISTA) '\", \"b'3. Geographic Focus '\", \"b'With exceptions as noted specifically below, activities supported under the HIV-VISTA project '\", \"b'will be implemented exclusively in SSA, which is the geographic area in the world with the highest-'\", \"b'burden of HIV. Activities should be implemented in at least three different countries in SSA. '\", \"b'Exceptions can be made for activities related to the procurement of laboratory commodities, which '\", \"b'are not available on the continent; for manufacturing of candidate vaccines, immunogens, or '\", \"b'delivery devices, which might in certain circumstances need to be conducted outside of SSA; or for '\", \"b'engaging highly specialized technical assistance on certain topics for which the needed expertise is '\", \"b'not yet available in SSA.  '\", \"b'4. Technical and Strategic Approach '\", \"b'The HIV-VISTA program will focus on utilizing the existing capacity, scientific talent, and '\", \"b'ingenuity in SSA to advance the HIV vaccine field through supporting activities in the following '\", \"b'five interrelated areas:    '\", \"b'A. Design and implement early-stage clinical trials of HIV vaccine immunogens '\", \"b'There is a pressing need within the HIV vaccine field to conduct many early-stage clinical trials in '\", \"b'the coming years.  It is therefore expected that clinical trials under HIV-VISTA will be primarily '\", \"b'Phase I or other experimental medicine studies. Given the time necessary to appropriately plan and '\", \"b'prepare for new trials and to start up the new project, it is envisioned that clinical trials supported '\", \"b'under HIV-VISTA would not be initiated until the second year of the project and that the bulk of '\", \"b'the implementation and associated costs for any proposed trials would occur in years three to five '\", \"b'of the proposed project. Clinical trials supported under HIV-VISTA do not necessarily need to be '\", \"b'on a linear product development path, but should be designed to generate findings that would have '\", \"b'practical application to future HIV vaccine candidates. For example, germ-line targeting '\", \"b'immunogens for a specific region of the envelope gene, experimental medicine trials of possible T-'\", \"b'cell epitopes, trials comparing different adjuvants, and/or trials exploring approaches to sustained '\", \"b'release of immunogens might not be intended to proceed directly to a phase II trial but could be '\", \"b'designed to provide critical information to inform the design of future vaccine candidates. Though '\", \"b'different trials supported under HIV-VISTA may have a diverse range of scientific aims, all trials '\", \"b'within the program will be expected to provide actionable insights to help optimize future HIV '\", \"b'vaccine candidate products that would address viral, host, and environmental factors in sub-Saharan '\", \"b'African populations.   '\", \"b'In light of the focus in the HIV vaccine field on developing vaccine candidates that produce bNAbs, '\", \"b'HIV-VISTA will put a primary emphasis on testing immunogens that are designed to elicit humoral '\", \"b'responses. While the focus will be especially on humoral response, the program will also include '\", \"b'complementary components related to testing strategies for stimulating improved cell-mediated '\", \"b'responses, including not only those intended to induce T-follicular helper responses but also those '\", \"b'focused on eliciting cytotoxic T-cells. HIV-VISTA is focused on advancing the field toward the '\", \"b'long-term goal of a preventive HIV vaccine, and therefore trials conducted under the project will '\", \"b'primarily, if not exclusively, involve HIV-uninfected participants. However, small experimental '\", \"b'studies of envelope immunogens in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), that are designed to '\", \"b'provide information to optimize bNAb responses, could also be supported in cases where these '\", \"b'    Page 5 of 48 '\", \"b'NOFO #7200AA23RFA00002  '\", \"b'HIV Vaccine Innovation, Science, and Technology Acceleration in Africa (HIV-VISTA) '\", \"b'would be an efficient way of generating data on priming, shepherding, and/or boosting approaches '\", \"b'that could be applied to preventive HIV vaccines.  '\", \"b'B. Conduct laboratory analyses on samples from trials and epidemiological studies  '\", \"b'Gaining a better understanding of human immune responses to HIV immunogens will be critical to '\", \"b'informing future HIV vaccine development efforts and will also provide learnings for the broader '\", \"b'field of vaccinology. Any trials that are proposed to be implemented during the HIV-VISTA project '\", \"b'will be accompanied by in-depth immunologic analyses to glean information about B cell, T-cell, '\", \"b'and additional humoral/cell-mediated immune responses that will inform vaccine design. In '\", \"b'addition, the HIV-VISTA program may also support immunological analyses to learn from samples '\", \"b'from clinical trials or other epidemiologic studies that have already been conducted on the African '\", \"b'continent, in cases where there is a strong rationale regarding how these analyses would provide '\", \"b'useful information to advance HIV vaccine science. Analyses that are designed to better understand '\", \"b'the effects of host genetics on HIV-specific immune responses could also be included. '\", \"b'While funds provided under the HIV-VISTA project are not envisioned to support new prospective '\", \"b'epidemiological studies, smaller, less expensive cross-sectional studies could potentially be '\", \"b'supported in cases where these provide useful data for HIV vaccine design. These may include '\", \"b'cross-sectional studies that identify new bNAbs and specific HIV envelopes that have triggered '\", \"b'their development. Of particular interest is research in relatively understudied populations that may '\", \"b'provide practical insights to inform vaccine design, including, for example, infected infants and '\", \"b'young children, who may provide examples of faster paths to bNAb evolution, and co-infected '\", \"b'couples and/or mother-infant pairs who both develop bNAbs, which may provide examples of viral '\", \"b'envelopes that are more likely to trigger bNAbs in a variety of host genetic backgrounds. '\", \"b'C. Test innovative preclinical HIV vaccine concepts, advancing the most promising '\", \"b'candidates toward clinical trials '\", \"b'Along with clinical trials and human immunological studies, there is a need for many new '\", \"b'preclinical HIV vaccine concepts to be developed and tested over the coming years in order to '\", \"b'advance the field toward the long-term goal of a globally effective vaccine. In response to this need, '\", \"b'HIV-VISTA will support African investigators to test innovative approaches to generate improved '\", \"b'HIV-specific immune responses, with the goal of having at least one of the most promising '\", \"b'approaches ready to advance into clinical studies by the end of the five-year project. Innovative '\", \"b'concepts explored under HIV-VISTA could relate to one or more of the following areas: 1) new '\", \"b'formulations or delivery methods; 2) new HIV immunogens; and/or 3) new adjuvants. While '\", \"b'concepts in these areas can be designed in partnership with private sector companies and/or '\", \"b'academic institutions outside sub-Saharan Africa, SSA investigators should play a leadership role '\", \"b'in conceptualizing any new approaches that are proposed for funding.   '\", \"b'Concerning new formulations or delivery methods, of particular interest are approaches that could '\", \"b'enable long-acting continuous or pulsatile delivery after a single dose. Emerging evidence suggests '\", \"b'that the quality and magnitude of immune responses can potentially be improved for some antigens '\", \"b'by the continuous release of technologies such as osmotic pumps, but such technologies may be '\", \"b'costly or impractical to implement, especially in low-and-middle-income countries. Therefore, '\", \"b'other formulations are needed that might enable continuous, long-acting release in a more practical '\", \"b'and affordable way. On the other hand, immunization approaches that rely on germ-line targeting '\", \"b'    Page 6 of 48 '\", \"b'NOFO #7200AA23RFA00002  '\", \"b'HIV Vaccine Innovation, Science, and Technology Acceleration in Africa (HIV-VISTA) '\", \"b'and stepwise immunizations with shepherding and boosting antigens may present challenges to '\", \"b'implement, and therefore practical approaches for pulsatile release of different antigens after a '\", \"b'single injection are also of potential interest. Technologies for \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cneedleless\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d administration '\", \"b'including microarray patches or oral administration of vaccines are also encouraged for their '\", \"b'potential to simplify implementation. Also of interest are delivery methods that may make nucleic-'\", \"b'acid-based vaccine approaches more cost-effective and more heat-stable, such as, for example,  '\", \"b'methods of formulating Ribonucleic Acid (RNA)-vaccines to reduce cold-chain dependence, self-'\", \"b'amplifying RNA vaccines that could reduce costs, plasmid DNA-delivered self-amplifying RNA '\", \"b'approaches, which may improve stability and reduce costs, or other non-RNA-based approaches '\", \"b'that may use liposomes to deliver DNA-based vaccines. '\", \"b'With regard to HIV immunogens, of particular interest are new HIV envelope constructs that have '\", \"b'been derived from viruses that were sequenced from epidemiological studies of people living with '\", \"b'HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan African countries who developed bNAbs. One approach that may hold '\", \"b'promise is delivering multiple different envelopes within virus-like particles via RNA and or within '\", \"b'a given liposome to form chimeras that might focus the immune system on conserved epitopes. '\", \"b'Concerning new adjuvants, of particular interest are molecular adjuvants that could be combined '\", \"b'with RNA-based delivery to improve the magnitude, durability, or quality of B and T cell responses. '\", \"b'These might include co-stimulatory molecules co-expressed with antigens delivered by RNA, '\", \"b'cytokines, or other creative possibilities to enhance responses.  '\", \"b'D. Strengthen systems of collaborations for HIV vaccine research in SSA and increase '\", \"b'opportunities to advance the careers of promising sub-Saharan African scientists  '\", \"b'Sub-Saharan African-led systems of scientific collaboration and coordination will be invaluable for '\", \"b'advancing the development of HIV vaccines. This includes long-term scientific South-South '\", \"b'collaborations and cross-fertilization between SSA-led research institutions in the HIV vaccine '\", \"b'field, as well as broader partnerships with other key stakeholders in SSA and beyond, including '\", \"b'regional sub-Saharan African institutions, regulatory authorities, academic institutions, and private '\", \"b'sector product developers. Collaborative approaches to strengthen biobanking and sample sharing '\", \"b'between SSA institutions are also important and can help enable more lab analyses to be done on '\", \"b'the continent.  Cloud-based and innovative data systems can also be an important tool to enhance '\", \"b'scientific collaboration within the continent and beyond.  '\", \"b'Additionally, to enhance the impact and sustainability of the HIV vaccine enterprise in SSA more '\", \"b'opportunities are needed for promising sub-Saharan African scientists, including postdoctoral '\", \"b'fellows, early-career investigators, and mid-career investigators, to support them to take increasing '\", \"b'scientific leadership for long-term projects that extend beyond one or two years. Mentoring '\", \"b'programs for local investigators and scientists through partnerships with academic institutions in '\", \"b'SSA, the United States, and other countries as opportunities arise.  '\", \"b'E. Partner with civil society advocates, affected communities including those at-risk and '\", \"b'people living with HIV/AIDS, policymakers, and communicators to advance sub-'\", \"b'Saharan African-led HIV vaccine science  '\", \"b'Just as sub-Saharan African-led systems of collaboration are required to advance the scientific '\", \"b'components of HIV vaccine development, a solid foundation of SSA-led advocacy to support these '\", \"b'efforts is also essential. USAID has invested in advocates who have effectively strengthened sub-'\", \"b'    Page 7 of 48 '\", \"b'NOFO #7200AA23RFA00002  '\", \"b'HIV Vaccine Innovation, Science, and Technology Acceleration in Africa (HIV-VISTA) '\", \"b'Saharan individuals and local organizations through strategic South-South collaborations around '\", \"b'HIV prevention research; these coalitions require sustained support. The strategic advancement of '\", \"b'prevention research and eventual rollout of effective interventions as key components of the global '\", \"b'AIDS response must be led by those most affected. Consulting and engaging communities early in '\", \"b'the development process is vital to ensuring that a product is acceptable and meets the needs of '\", \"b'those it intends to protect. To promote inclusive participation, key population members should be '\", \"b'prioritized, alongside (and intersecting with) people living with HIV/AIDS. '\", \"b'Sub-Saharan African-led advocacy capable of engaging civil society, especially key stakeholders, '\", \"b'across the HIV vaccine field will require continued investment, attention, and technical support to '\", \"b'allow advocates to fully leverage the foundation that has been established to achieve the collective, '\", \"b'longer-term vision of true sustainability and durable self-reliance. As the HIV prevention landscape '\", \"b'grows, new biomedical tools with limited efficacy and uptake are being introduced. These novel '\", \"b'approaches can add complexities to trials of new interventions like HIV vaccine candidates and '\", \"b'passive immunization with bNAbs, necessitating modified trial designs.

PHASE 2: CO-CREATION '\", \"b'Successful applicants at the initial concept paper phase will be invited to engage in a co-creation '\", \"b'process with USAID as follows. '\", \"b'Phase 2a: VIRTUAL CO-CREATION WORKSHOP: The first phase of the co-creation '\", \"b'process will be a five-day virtual workshop from 8 AM to 12 PM EST to which all successful '\", \"b'applicants of concept papers will be invited. For each successful concept paper, up to 2 '\", \"b'representatives of the prime organization applying can attend. Applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s will also be given '\", \"b'the option if they so desire of bringing with them 1-2 representatives from any local '\", \"b'organizations who possess technical knowledge of the subject matter, were instrumental in '\", \"b'drafting the concept paper, and are included as subpartners on their concept note. In choosing '\", \"b'who should attend from their respective organizations, applicants should prioritize staff that '\", \"b'have technical and scientific knowledge relevant to HIV vaccine R&D, rather than staff whose '\", \"b'main responsibilities relate to business development, human resources, or other non-technical '\", \"b'areas. The co-creation process may create opportunities for new partnerships between various '\", \"b'organizations, and therefore USAID recommends that applicants consider avoiding entering '\", \"b'into binding agreements with potential subpartners ahead of the co-creation process so that '\", \"b'there will be maximum flexibility in developing collaborations during the workshop.  '\", \"b'The week prior to the virtual co-creation workshop, USAID will also offer an optional 2-hour '\", \"b'pre-workshop orientation call during which the co-creation process will be explained and '\", \"b'applicants will have the opportunity to ask any questions they may have about the process.  '\", \"b'The goal of a co-creation workshop would be to explore and validate key challenges and '\", \"b'problems in HIV vaccine R&D, and then jointly to develop promising solutions or adapt and '\", \"b'expand upon existing solutions. USAID envisions the initial product of the workshop to be a '\", \"b'draft framework from each applicant or group of applicants that has decided to work together '\", \"b'for how they plan to address the objective in the NOFO.  '\", \"b'Day 1:  USAID presentation will provide an overview of key challenges and priorities it sees '\", \"b'related to HIV vaccine R&D (with a specific focus on SSA), share about USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s existing '\", \"b'support for HIV vaccine R&D projects, and identify general strengths, weaknesses, and gaps '\", \"b'it noted from the concept papers.  '\", \"b'Note:  USAID will NOT discuss any specific details of what individual applicants proposed '\", \"b'    Page 14 of 48 '\", \"b'NOFO #7200AA23RFA00002  '\", \"b'HIV Vaccine Innovation, Science, and Technology Acceleration in Africa (HIV-VISTA) '\", \"b'in their concept notes during this evaluation period.     '\", \"b'Applicant presentation - Each applicant will then each be allotted equal time to present their '\", \"b'organization\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s capabilities and what they see as the key challenges and opportunities in HIV '\", \"b'vaccine R&D. At their discretion, applicants will have the option of also sharing specifics '\", \"b'about existing solutions, approaches, or activities from their concept papers. These may be '\", \"b'discussed and further developed in the workshop with the larger group, but workshop '\", \"b'thinking, and possible eventual full applications, will not be limited to these ideas.  '\", \"b'At the end of the first half-day, USAID and the applicants will then begin to discuss together '\", \"b'possible solutions for how to address identified gaps and challenges.  '\", \"b'Day 2: After a summary of the prior day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s discussion, other donors and companies involved '\", \"b'in HIV vaccine R&D will share about their relevant priorities and capabilities to address the '\", \"b'NOFO objectives. Applicants will then break into small groups to discuss specific challenges '\", \"b'and solutions relating to HIV vaccine R&D, before reporting back to the larger group.  '\", \"b'Day 3:  Applicants will be provided the opportunity to discuss possible collaborations with '\", \"b'one another, including possibly forming new consortia, to support proposed solutions and '\", \"b'activities. USAID will be available to answer any questions as needed.  '\", \"b'Day 4: A one day break will take place during the five-day virtual workshop. '\", \"b'Day 5: Each group will present a draft framework to USAID for how they would address the '\", \"b'objectives of the NOFO and USAID would provide comments and suggestions for the '\", \"b'applicants to consider to strengthen the framework. '\", \"b'Applicants would then be given two weeks (10 calendar days) to finalize their frameworks '\", \"b'and flesh out their specific plans in greater detail, including selection/identification of a prime.  '\", \"b'Phase 2b: IN-PERSON CO-CREATION MEETING '\", \"b'During the second phase of the co-creation, USAID staff will meet separately with each group '\", \"b'of applicants/consortium for 1-2 days at a location in SSA, TBD. The location will be selected '\", \"b'with consideration given to the locations where the applicants come from with a view toward '\", \"b'minimizing travel costs and travel distances for applicants to the extent possible.  Applicants '\", \"b'will present their specific plans and USAID can provide feedback on these plans or answer '\", \"b'other questions as needed.  '\", \"b'The desired outcome of this second phase will be a strong draft program description from '\", \"b'each applicant/consortium for the full application phase, as well as quantitative and/or '\", \"b'qualitative indicators or performance milestones. This draft program description will then be '\", \"b'revised by the applicant as they finalize the program description to submit as part of their '\", \"b'technical application according to the instructions for the program description section '\", \"b'described in Section D4.c.i.4 below.

Applications are sought '\", \"b'that complement the PSNP5 and build on the extensive lessons and experiences of previous USAID '\", \"b'and GoE-funded programs, particularly the PSNP4 Livelihood Component, USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Graduation '\", \"b'with Resilience to Achieve Sustainable Development (GRAD) and the Livelihoods for Resilience '\", \"b'(L4R) activities.    '\", \"b'HRA must subscribe to the general framework outlined by the PSNP5 livelihood component, which '\", \"b'articulates three key livelihood pathways: on-farm, off-farm and employment. USAID/Ethiopia '\", \"b'seeks applications that apply market systems approaches to improve: (1) on-farm crop and livestock '\", \"b'income generation, (2) off-farm enterprise development (3) wage employment, (4) diet quality and '\", \"b'quantity (and nutrition) and (5) collaborative learning for scaling and sustaining gains. '\", \"b'HRA also subscribes to USAID/Ethiopia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) '\", \"b'that calls for collaboration and coordination among USAID investments to maximize effectiveness '\", \"b'and impact. HRA will target PSNP5 clients in five highland regions of Ethiopia: Tigray, Amhara, '\", \"b'Oromia, SNNP and Sidama. Theoretically, all PSNP5 implementing woredas in these regions are '\", \"b'eligible; however, priority will be given to woredas within the market sheds of other USAID funded '\", \"b'programs, particularly in the Feed the Future Ethiopia Zone of Influence and similar activities '\", \"b'implemented/funded by the GoE and other development partners.  '\", \"b'A2. '\", \"b'Country Context and Problem Statement '\", \"b'Country Context '\", \"b'Over the past 20 years, Ethiopia has made significant progress in improving health, nutrition, '\", \"b'education, and other human development indicators. Life expectancy has risen dramatically, and '\", \"b'the percentage of the population living in poverty and hunger has fallen by a third in the last 10 '\", \"b'years. Sustained economic growth and strong pro-poor spending by the GoE have been critical to '\", \"b'1 Graduation threshold is the cost of meeting not just minimum food and livelihood costs in an '\", \"b'average year, but also includes a buffer to allow people to withstand the impact of a moderate '\", \"b'shock.  '\", \"b'4 '\", \"b' Request for Application # 72066323RFA00004 '\", \"b'Highlands Resilience Activity '\", \"b'this success, supported by the commitment of development partners such as USAID to support '\", \"b'Ethiopia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s aspirations in poverty reduction. Progress in rural livelihoods drove poverty reduction '\", \"b'in the past and will likely do so in the future. Despite impressive economic growth for the last one '\", \"b'and a half decade, Ethiopia remains one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita '\", \"b'annual income estimated at $883 (MoF, 2019). Millions of Ethiopians suffer from the combination '\", \"b'of poverty, vulnerability, malnutrition and food insecurity that erodes community and household '\", \"b'resilience. Population density is high in the highlands and a large proportion of these households '\", \"b'are without access to sufficient land and other productive assets. These factors are exacerbated by '\", \"b'climate change, conflict and other acute and chronic shocks and stresses. The natural resources base '\", \"b'remains the foundation for most livelihoods and is subject to considerable climate risks. '\", \"b'Furthermore, the current conflict in the northern part of Ethiopia (Tigray, Amhara and Afar regions) '\", \"b'has had significant implications on the overall economic growth of these regions and has reduced '\", \"b'the existing asset base of many of these chronically food insecure households. Acute malnutrition '\", \"b'rates have risen dramatically, and the health status of women and children has deteriorated. The '\", \"b'conflict may have damaged some community-held productive assets in the target area of Northern '\", \"b'Ethiopia, such as flood prevention infrastructure, roads, and markets. Given these facts, Livelihoods '\", \"b'activities need to incorporate a reduced asset base and the need to restore infrastructure into their '\", \"b'application and targeting process. In addition, applicants should include market analysis in their '\", \"b'approach to assess the effects of the conflict on market access and function for the target '\", \"b'population.   '\", \"b'As a result of these factors, a significant segment of the population continues to need food '\", \"b'assistance. For instance, in October 2020, the Ethiopian  Disaster Risk Management Commission '\", \"b'(EDRMC) indicated that more than 15 million Ethiopians were in need of humanitarian assistance '\", \"b'due '\", \"b'to '\", \"b'pocket '\", \"b'area '\", \"b'drought, '\", \"b'floods, '\", \"b'COVID-19 '\", \"b'and '\", \"b'aggressive '\", \"b'locust '\", \"b'damage  (https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia) and in 2021, the draft Humanitarian Response Plan '\", \"b'estimated that 13.7 million people needed emergency food assistance. The USAID Joint Emergency '\", \"b'Operations Program (JEOP) is USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s primary vehicle for providing humanitarian food '\", \"b'assistance to more than 5.3 million transitory food insecure and conflict-affected Ethiopians. '\", \"b'USAID also provides food and nutrition humanitarian assistance across the country through the '\", \"b'United Nations World Food Program (WFP) and UNICEF.   '\", \"b'The GOE began the PSNP in 2005 in order to provide predictable and timely assistance to '\", \"b'chronically food-insecure households and bridge their food need gap and also help them to invest '\", \"b'in new livelihood activities that would yield new income and build assets. Multiple development '\", \"b'partners support the PSNP implementation. Now, the PSNP supports over eight million people in '\", \"b'more than 470 woredas. It has helped food-insecure households smoothing consumption (increase '\", \"b'the number of months the family feeds itself), buffering shocks by preventing degradation of and '\", \"b'restoring natural resources and building or rehabilitating social infrastructure (schools, health '\", \"b'centers, roads, and so on). PSNP is now in its fifth cycle (2021-2025) with a total budget of $2.3 '\", \"b'billion.   '\", \"b'A key metric used to assess the effectiveness of PSNP4 was the rate of client graduation from the '\", \"b'program. With USAID support, the PSNP4 provided augmented livelihoods support to '\", \"b'approximately 120,000 PSNP clients to strengthen and diversify their livelihood strategies along '\", \"b'the three livelihoods pathways: 1) crop and livestock (on-farm) enterprises 2) off-farm enterprises '\", \"b'5 '\", \"b' Request for Application # 72066323RFA00004 '\", \"b'Highlands Resilience Activity '\", \"b'and 3) wage employment. Implementing partners staff including kebele-level community '\", \"b'facilitators recruited by USG funded livelihoods activities helped households develop business '\", \"b'plans for more productive farm (crop/livestock) and off-farm enterprises and to seek formal wage '\", \"b'employment opportunities. Because ultra-poor households have little to no chance of receiving '\", \"b'loans from financial institutions, PSNP4 provided a one-off $200 livelihood grant to 10% of the '\", \"b'targeted HHs to help start their businesses. Other PSNP clients were supported in obtaining access '\", \"b'to credit from financial services providers (particularly micro finance institutions (MFIs) and rural '\", \"b'cooperative unions) to start their businesses.   '\", \"b'Unfortunately, the graduation results from the PSNP4 were lower than expected. This is due to the '\", \"b'absence of clear criteria and objective verification methods for graduation eligibility that can '\", \"b'replace the Graduation Prediction System (GPS), a complex and unfriendly tool to be used by front '\", \"b'line implementers.  '\", \"b'PSNP4 also introduced linkages to health and nutrition services for pregnant and lactating women '\", \"b'(PLW) and children, as well as nutrition-sensitive public works such as construction of WASH '\", \"b'facilities and childcare centers. PSNP5 was designed to build on and complement these efforts by '\", \"b'integrating nutrition interventions across the livelihoods component. The PSNP5 livelihoods '\", \"b'component \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cseeks to contribute to the nutrition outcomes of the households\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d through nutrition-'\", \"b'smart value chains, messaging and training on use of increased income for improved dietary '\", \"b'diversity, development of a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cnutrition-sensitive livelihood menu\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and other creative approaches to '\", \"b'improve women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s and children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s diets.      '\", \"b'The PSNP5 emphasizes the importance of recalibrating livelihood strengthening support in order '\", \"b'to accelerate the graduation rate. This approach is referred to as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Big Push\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d.  PSNP 5\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Big '\", \"b'Push approach has the following defining characteristics:  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Targeting fewer households: The PSNP5 aims to enable 20% of PSNP households to '\", \"b'graduate from PSNP by improving their livelihoods through a combination of time-bound '\", \"b'and appropriate strategies and investments. Targeted ultra-poor households will receive a '\", \"b'one-time $300 livelihoods grant. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Tailoring support to client\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s needs: The Big Push emphasizes the importance of tailoring '\", \"b'livelihood assistance to clients\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 specific needs, capacities and context rather than '\", \"b'implementing broad, one-size-fits-all interventions. Targeted clients will receive intense '\", \"b'and high-quality support to help them exit from the program faster. Additional community '\", \"b'facilitators will be hired to provide training/coaching to targeted households. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Increased focus on improving women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s economic opportunities: The Big Push aims to '\", \"b'address gender gaps in access to inputs as well as ownership and control of assets through '\", \"b'1) targeted training for women focused on agriculture/livestock production and marketing; '\", \"b'2) targeting 50% of the PSNP livelihood grants for women; and 3) targeted interventions '\", \"b'for women to increase their participation in wage employment. '\", \"b'6 '\", \"b' Request for Application # 72066323RFA00004 '\", \"b'Highlands Resilience Activity '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Increasing livelihood diversification to build resilience: The Big Push will promote intra-'\", \"b'household livelihood diversification, particularly in the off-farm and employment pathways, '\", \"b'to reduce income reliance on rainfed agriculture on small plots of land. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Integrating youth in livelihood promotion: In addition to targeting youth for livelihood '\", \"b'strengthening activities, PSNP5 aims to support youth to become community facilitators '\", \"b'and work with kebele development agents to implement various elements of the PSNP '\", \"b'including public works planning, client verification and provision of training to Big Push '\", \"b'clients. '\", \"b'Problem Statement '\", \"b'After 15 years of the PSNP, graduation from the program remains low, with some households never '\", \"b'achieving graduation and others returning to the program a few years after being declared graduates. '\", \"b'Livelihood strategies remain vulnerable, characterized by subsistence low productivity and '\", \"b'diversity. According to our analysis, efforts to improve livelihoods and thus graduation rates at '\", \"b'scale have yielded limited success mainly due to an over-reliance on donor resources and over-'\", \"b'burdened frontline workers to implement the livelihood approach. While the government plays a '\", \"b'critical and irreplaceable role, the needs far surpass government resources. The capacity of the '\", \"b'government to adopt and scale up good lessons and practices of the livelihood interventions to all '\", \"b'PSNP and non-PSNP woredas was very limited.  '\", \"b'Significant and sustained improvements in viable livelihood strategies cannot be achieved without '\", \"b'substantial private sector engagement, expertise and investment. PSNP clients tend to live in remote '\", \"b'communities that are less well integrated into the economy (See Tessema et al (2019). As a result, '\", \"b'PSNP clients face many barriers to access the markets and business development services, including '\", \"b'access to finance, needed to grow their on-farm and off-farm businesses. Off-farm business '\", \"b'enterprises are key contributors to employment, economic growth and poverty reduction; and its '\", \"b'importance increases through time as the productivity of the on-farm activities are more and more '\", \"b'challenged due to declining land quality and land size as well as population pressure. Studies show '\", \"b'that only 23 percent of households in rural Ethiopia have a non-farm enterprise, which is low by '\", \"b'regional standards. Limited access to credit constraints household investment, particularly in non-'\", \"b'farm activities. Besides the lack of suitable adequate finance, challenging business environment, '\", \"b'low level of core business skills, insufficient demand for rural MSMEs produce, low productivity, '\", \"b'gender disparities, marginalization and other elements affect the growth of the off-farm sub-sector. '\", \"b'Viable employment opportunities are also very limited, as various barriers and weak incentives '\", \"b'constrain the private sector\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s capacity to expand their businesses into PSNP areas and to hire and '\", \"b'train PSNP clients.  '\", \"b'In addition, consumption of a diverse diet is also low among PSNP clients, due to the constraints '\", \"b'listed above limiting access to nutritious foods throughout the year as well as to information and '\", \"b'counseling services to support adoption of improved dietary and nutrition practices. All of the above '\", \"b'challenges are exacerbated for women and youth due to disparities in access to productive resources '\", \"b'and agency. Finally, while many of these constraints are known, solutions that can be efficiently '\", \"b'and effectively scaled to achieve transformative change and permanently reduce vulnerability, '\", \"b'including how to assess graduation \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9creadiness\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d, are not well understood.  '\", \"b'7 '\", \"b' Request for Application # 72066323RFA00004 '\", \"b'Highlands Resilience Activity '\", \"b'Low rates of financial inclusion remain a binding constraint for households to graduate from the '\", \"b'PSNP.  An assessment made by the Association of Ethiopian Microfinance Institute informed that '\", \"b'only 10% of households in Ethiopia have access to formal credit and only 1% of the rural population '\", \"b'has a bank account. Ethiopia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s weak financial system \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cenhances the risk and costs of services and '\", \"b'thus economically unrealistic business proposals. Failures on the market, such as asymmetric '\", \"b'information, monopoly of financial markets or oligopoly and accessibility barriers for new '\", \"b'competitors are obstacles to part of the population which are excluded due to prices, risks, and '\", \"b'lower supplies.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d PSNP households are disproportionately affected by ineffective financial '\", \"b'institutions as the high cost of financial access creates an additional barrier to entry to on-farm and '\", \"b'off-farm business ventures. To help address this gap, USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s livelihood activities developed and '\", \"b'applied a Loan Guarantee Fund (LGF) facility that incentivized Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) '\", \"b'and Rural Savings and Credit Cooperatives (RUSaCCOs) to create better loan access to targeted '\", \"b'HHs. However, the expectation of the Guarantee Fund accelerating loan access to a large number '\", \"b'of PSNP households from the financial services providers (FSPs) has not been fully materialized '\", \"b'mainly due to FSPs capacity limitations (e.g., liquidity constraints) and outreach/geographic '\", \"b'coverage (FSPs operate mainly in towns and semi-urban areas and lack presence in remote rural '\", \"b'areas).  '\", \"b'Inclusive economic growth in rural Ethiopia is hampered by poor integration between rural '\", \"b'producers and consumers with semi-urban and urban markets, negatively impacting exit from the '\", \"b'PSNP. Tessema et al (2019) posit four antecedents required for market integration by rural '\", \"b'producers, including 1) production factors (such as landholdings, farm labor, and inputs; 2) '\", \"b'infrastructure - roads and market infrastructure; 3) market standards, including quality standards '\", \"b'and market information; and 4) neighborhood effect - the extent to which smallholders can learn '\", \"b'from increased market integration of other producers. While the PSNP contributes to all of these '\", \"b'areas with more focus on the first two antecedents in its livelihood approach, significant challenges '\", \"b'remain in all four areas. Furthermore, according to the WFP\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s 2019 Comprehensive Food Security '\", \"b'and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA), roughly 70% of Ethiopia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rural population must travel six '\", \"b'hours to reach all-weather roads and only 28.8% of the rural population is within 2 kilometers from '\", \"b'a market. A 2018 World Bank assessment suggests that poverty rates increase by 7% every ten '\", \"b'additional kilometers from a market town. Loening et al (2009) found that enterprises located in '\", \"b'rural towns are 50% more profitable than those in remote areas of Ethiopia. The same study found '\", \"b'that demand for non-farm products is much higher when localized agricultural performance is '\", \"b'strong. These findings suggest that a livelihood promotion program targeting PSNP households '\", \"b'needs to focus on areas within proximity to a major market and with the potential for strong '\", \"b'localized agricultural performance.  '\", \"b'PSNP clients tend to be more remote than the average rural dweller and therefore their farm and '\", \"b'off-farm businesses suffer more from market fragmentation and low last-mile service provision of '\", \"b'key market-oriented services, such as access to market information and the specialized improved '\", \"b'inputs, technologies, know-how, training in improved production, post-harvest handling support '\", \"b'and aggregation required to access high-value markets. '\", \"b'Nutrition is critical to improving household resilience and livelihoods. While Ethiopia has seen '\", \"b'significant progress in maternal and child nutrition outcomes over the last decade, access to safe, '\", \"b'affordable, and nutritious diets remains a challenge.

While there '\", \"b'are limited national figures on women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dietary diversity, a 2021 meta-analysis in Ethiopia found '\", \"b'that less than half of pregnant and breastfeeding women (45.9%) consumed a minimally adequate '\", \"b'diet. And a recent study by IFPRI found that only 5.6% of pregnant and lactating women (PLW) in '\", \"b'PSNP 4 households had a minimally diverse diet, pointing to serious nutritional vulnerability in '\", \"b'this population. The economic consequences of undernutrition are significant. The 2011 Cost of '\", \"b'Hunger study estimated that Ethiopia loses up to 16.5% of GDP due to undernutrition every year. '\", \"b'Women in PSNP households face social inequalities that present additional barriers to accessing '\", \"b'information, opportunities and resources to improve their livelihoods.

'\", \"b'In the past years, Ethiopia has taken major steps in investing to improve human capital, education '\", \"b'and health and improving rural infrastructure.

'\", \"b'Finally, there is a critical need to rethink the concept of graduation from the PSNP.

These include annual '\", \"b'work plans and a monitoring, evaluation, and learning plan. '\", \"b' I. Annual Work Plans '\", \"b'The Recipient will submit an annual work plan that describes all proposed activities, including '\", \"b'expected accomplishments and progress towards achieving results. The work plan for each fiscal '\", \"b'year will be finalized in consultation with USAID/Ethiopia with approval by the AOR.

Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) '\", \"b'USAID expects the Recipient to have a robust MEL Plan that is fit-for-purpose to enable evidence-'\", \"b'driven adaptation by both the Recipient and USAID. The MEL Plan outlines the approaches and '\", \"b'resources for learning opportunities for adaptation, measuring results and achievements of activity, '\", \"b'collaborating, and adapting. '\", \"b'26 '\", \"b' Request for Application # 72066323RFA00004 '\", \"b'Highlands Resilience Activity '\", \"b'The MEL plan must include sex disaggregated indicators to track accomplishments in relation to '\", \"b'the Activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s goals and objectives and to track the performance of the Activity in achieving '\", \"b'outcomes specific to the priority areas and its contribution to the higher-level results of USAID '\", \"b'Ethiopia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s FTF investments. Primarily, it should include those indicators that the Mission needs for '\", \"b'activity management and align with the results framework. The successful Applicant will finalize '\", \"b'the performance monitoring indicators in consultation with the USAID AOR.  '\", \"b'Applicants should also propose a strategy for collecting, analyzing and reporting data in the MEL '\", \"b'plan and include a strategy for aligning with and complementing performance monitoring indicators '\", \"b'and data collection with other relevant projects such as RFSAs. This will support the HRA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'objective of effective layering with other USAID activities, improve the efficiency and reduce the '\", \"b'cost of data collection efforts across activities and generate a base of information to assess the '\", \"b'combined impact of interventions. '\", \"b'Given that the Mission has invested significantly in generating baseline and performance data on '\", \"b'graduation interventions and related activities, the draft MEL plan should be informed by these '\", \"b'investments. The draft MEL plan should include a proposed approach for i) coordinating activities '\", \"b'with an external impact evaluation and ii) identifying what performance monitoring data might be '\", \"b'needed to support the impact evaluation. For example, monitoring data at the household and, where '\", \"b'relevant, individual or enterprise levels, on the number and type of interventions received would be '\", \"b'necessary to evaluate the plausible contribution of the HRA. Details will be provided in the award '\", \"b'document. '\", \"b'Site visits to the HRA operational areas will also occur any time after the initial six-month period '\", \"b'of implementation. For the first six months, USAID/Ethiopia staff will meet regularly with the '\", \"b'activity staff to ensure that start-up activities are on track. '\", \"b'At any time during the HRA implementation, USAID will conduct one or more external '\", \"b'performance evaluation(s) to review overall progress, assess the continuing appropriateness of the '\", \"b'design and identify any factors impeding effective implementation. USAID would use the results '\", \"b'of the evaluations to make appropriate course-corrections in implementation, if needed, and to help '\", \"b'determine appropriate future directions. The baseline survey will be conducted within six to one-'\", \"b'year of the start of implementation and the mid-term could be initiated at approximately 30 months '\", \"b'from the award date or at any time during the implementation if need arises. The end-term '\", \"b'evaluation may also be initiated based on information needs and availability of funds. The '\", \"b'successful implementing partner must make sure USAID and the implementing partner are '\", \"b'engaging and collaborating productively in the entire evaluations process and must facilitate full, '\", \"b'transparent, and timely access to data, documentation, personnel, and key stakeholders as '\", \"b'appropriate for the completion of the evaluations. '\", \"b'In cases where the implementing partner prefers to conduct an internal performance evaluation for '\", \"b'its own institutional learning or accountability purposes, it is critical to dedicate sufficient funding '\", \"b'within its application. '\", \"b'2. Collaborating, Learning, and Adapting (CLA)  '\", \"b'27 '\", \"b' Request for Application # 72066323RFA00004 '\", \"b'Highlands Resilience Activity '\", \"b'USAID has integrated Collaborating, Learning and Adapting into all aspects of its operations and '\", \"b'programming to achieve better development outcomes. Collaboration is a priority area for USAID '\", \"b'Ethiopia, given the importance of coordinating with GoE at federal, zonal, and woreda levels; with '\", \"b'other USAID Ethiopia investments and with market system actors, including households, '\", \"b'communities, development groups (that include VESAs), RuSACCOs, microfinance institutions, '\", \"b'cooperatives, common interest groups, and other local entities. This collaboration will enable the '\", \"b'HRA to scale up the layering and sequencing of past successful activities as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cgood practices.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d '\", \"b'Collaboration is necessary to avoid/minimize duplication and conflict of interests, learn and '\", \"b'exchange lessons and experiences (e.g. could be done through multi stakeholders\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 platforms at '\", \"b'relevant levels). The collaboration must go beyond the layering and sequencing of activities. It '\", \"b'should support learning from best practices and/or failure stories (if any) as well as promote scaling '\", \"b'up and adaptation.  '\", \"b'USAID believes that ongoing learning throughout implementation contributes to the achievement '\", \"b'of results. Ongoing learning allows activities to discover what is working, what is not and why and '\", \"b'adapt interventions and/or tactics accordingly. Adaptation requires flexibility including the ability '\", \"b'to drop unsuccessful experiments, adapt them or start as new as well as targets and indicators that '\", \"b'are based more on outcomes than outputs.  '\", \"b'The recipient will be required to regularly (at least on a quarterly basis) reflect on progress of '\", \"b'Activity implementation and achievements towards the goal and objectives of the Activity. '\", \"b'Reflection opportunities may also focus on challenges and successes in implementation, changes '\", \"b'in the operating environment or context that could affect the activity, opportunities to collaborate '\", \"b'with other USAID partners. The detailed format of the presentation and its contents will be '\", \"b'developed in collaboration with the AOR.   '\", \"b'The independent CLA platforms established at the Mission may assist with convening the pause '\", \"b'and reflect session with recipient and other USAID partners operating in the highlands of Ethiopia '\", \"b'and stakeholders to ensure linkages and synergistic learning across the USAID Ethiopia Mission '\", \"b'portfolio.  '\", \"b'c. Performance Reporting '\", \"b'Performance reporting, to be outlined in the MEL Plan, is intended to ensure that USAID has '\", \"b'sufficient information to effectively monitor the Activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s performance. This includes any '\", \"b'information regarding any development that may have a significant impact on performance, '\", \"b'including, but not limited to challenges encountered, and relevant context and information on costs '\", \"b'incurred compared to the approved budget plan for the Agreement. The Activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Performance '\", \"b'Monitoring Reporting differs from Financial Reporting as the latter is intended to address cash flow '\", \"b'needs and not performance. '\", \"b'I. '\", \"b'Quarterly Progress Check-in Presentations: - The Implementing Partner will provide a short '\", \"b'30-minute presentation quarterly to the USAID/Ethiopia and it shall be used as an adaptive '\", \"b'management tool. The presentation may include a summary of activities and key results and '\", \"b'achievements; information on management issues, including administrative, or coordination '\", \"b'problems; a comparison of actual accomplishments established for the period; reasons why '\", \"b'planned activities did not take place (if applicable); other pertinent information as specified '\", \"b'28 '\", \"b' Request for Application # 72066323RFA00004 '\", \"b'Highlands Resilience Activity '\", \"b'by the AOR in writing; and plans and intended outputs for the following quarterly period.

In this regard, note that the USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'annual reporting time covers the period from October 01 to September 30. Upon receiving '\", \"b'AOR approval, the approved Annual Report shall be submitted to the USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s DEC.  '\", \"b'V. '\", \"b'Close out Report: - As part of the close out procedures, the recipient will be required to '\", \"b'submit a demobilization plan to the AOR\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s approval 180 days prior to the completion date '\", \"b'of the award. '\", \"b'VI. '\", \"b'Final Performance Report: - The Final Performance Report will cover the entire period of '\", \"b'the award.

In order for an award to be made, a USAID Agreement Officer must make an '\", \"b'affirmative determination that the Applicant is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cresponsible,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as discussed in ADS 303.3.9.

USAID expects the recipient/recipients to propose at least 10% in '\", \"b'cost share. The HRA award, like its predecessor activity, is essentially a livelihoods promotion at '\", \"b'household level. It does not have any provision for capital funding or any type of construction '\", \"b'assistance. '\", \"b'Cost Share must be supported by adequate documentation, be allowable under the applicable cost '\", \"b'principles, and meet the criteria set forth in 2 CFR 200.306. In-kind contributions are allowable as '\", \"b'cost sharing in accordance with 2 CFR 200.306. Cost sharing contributions may include volunteer '\", \"b'services provided by professional and technical personnel; valuation of donated supplies, '\", \"b'equipment, and other property; and, use of unrecovered indirect costs. Funds that are paid by the '\", \"b'Federal Government through another source may not be used by an organization in cost share '\", \"b'calculations (see 2 CFR 200.306). Cost share contributions must be reported on a periodic basis '\", \"b'on payment forms, and USAID has the right to reduce its share of funding if the cost share '\", \"b'reported is less than the agreed upon percentage or amount contained in the award. Grantees '\", \"b'should be prepared to distinguish in their reporting the outputs and outcomes that result from cost '\", \"b'share contributions versus USAID monies. If a difference remains after an award has expired, the '\", \"b'Recipient may be required to refund the difference.  '\", \"b'USAID does not apply its source and nationality requirements, or the restricted goods provision '\", 'b\\'established in the Standard Provision \"USAID Eligibility Rules for Goods and Services\" to cost \\'', \"b'sharing contributions. '\", \"b'The AO may authorize the Recipient to attribute cost sharing contributions from sub-recipients to '\", \"b'the prime award.  '\", \"b'C.3 Risk Assessments  '\", \"b'For an award to be made, the USAID Agreement Officer must evaluate the risks posed by '\", \"b'Applicants as outlined in 2 CFR 200.205 and ADS 303.3.9.

These organizations '\", \"b'should take this into account and plan their implementation dates and activities accordingly.  '\", \"b'The successful Applicant(s) will be subject to a positive risk assessment by the Agreement '\", \"b'Officer (AO).  A positive risk assessment means that the applicant possesses or has the ability to '\", \"b'obtain the necessary management competence to plan and carry out the assistance program to be '\", \"b'funded, and that the applicant will practice mutually agreed upon methods of accountability for '\", \"b'funds and other assets provided by USAID.

'\", \"b'A. BACKGROUND '\", \"b'While Indonesia has made progress over the past decade toward reducing Tuberculosis (TB) '\", \"b'incidence and increasing treatment success rates, significant challenges to eliminating TB '\", \"b'remain.  In 2021, an estimated 969,000 people fell ill with TB in Indonesia and approximately '\", \"b'411 people died every day from the disease.1 Although case notifications (the number of cases '\", \"b'identified and reported) slightly recovered from 384,025 in 2020 to 432,577 in 2021, '\", \"b'notifications in 2021 continue to reflect less than half of TB cases.2 Consequently, many TB '\", \"b'patients remained either undiagnosed or diagnosed but not notified to the National '\", \"b'Tuberculosis Program (NTP) making it harder to find and treat TB cases. Of the new cases '\", \"b'diagnosed and started on care, 86 percent were successfully treated.3 However, in 2021, an '\", \"b'estimated 28,000 patients still developed drug resistant TB (DR-TB)/MDR-TB, but only roughly '\", \"b'30% (8,268) of cases were diagnosed and only 63 percent of those cases were initiated on '\", \"b'treatment.4 Meaning that drug resistant TB strains, which require longer treatment regimens '\", \"b'and are more expensive to treat, are still spreading in Indonesia. '\", \"b'At the national level, the past few years have marked strong political commitment by the '\", \"b'Government of Indonesia to address the TB epidemic. In the first UN high-level meeting on '\", \"b'TB held in 2018, Indonesia reaffirmed the sustainable development goal (SDG) target to '\", \"b'reduce the death rate from tuberculosis by 90% and reduce the incidence rate of '\", \"b'tuberculosis by up to 80% by 2030. Additionally, Indonesia pledged support for global targets '\", \"b'to treat 40 million people for TB and administer TB preventive treatment (TPT) to 30 million '\", \"b'people by 2022. With political will, came increases in domestic funding for TB, which more '\", \"b'than doubled from 53 million in 2017 to 109 million in 2019.5 Furthermore, the National '\", \"b'1 World Health Organization, Tuberculosis Profile: Indonesia, 202`1 data.

However, global progress is anticipated to '\", \"b'fall short of achieving 2030 TB targets.6 '\", \"b'In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic struck Indonesia, worsening national efforts in fighting '\", \"b'TB. As a result, progress on key TB indicators declined and Indonesia continues to grapple with '\", \"b'the second highest burden of TB in the world. 7  To regain lost ground on TB, President Jokowi '\", \"b'issued a decree to establish a multi-sectoral response to accelerate achievement of the 2030 '\", \"b'TB elimination targets as current efforts are insufficient to achieve TB elimination.8 '\", \"b'B. PROBLEM STATEMENT '\", \"b'More than 900,000 people continue to fall ill with TB in Indonesia every year and with the '\", \"b'COVID-19 pandemic TB notifications, treatment outcomes, and TPT uptake have further '\", \"b'declined. Without concerted and collaborative efforts to accelerate the detection, treatment, '\", \"b'and prevention of TB cases, Indonesia may not achieve its TB elimination targets by 2030. '\", \"b'Therefore, there is an urgent need to accelerate progress towards 2030 TB elimination '\", \"b'targets in Indonesia.

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION '\", \"b'The End TB strategy highlights the fundamental need to ensure early diagnosis and treatment '\", \"b'of patients with effective and uninterrupted anti-TB drugs. However, during the COVID-19 '\", \"b'pandemic, TB notifications declined by 31%11 in Indonesia. With the Accelerating Elimination of '\", \"b'Tuberculosis in Indonesia APS, USAID/Indonesia is planning to comprehensively address key '\", \"b'challenges in the national TB program and provide targeted support for national TB priorities, '\", \"b'which will result in significant improvement in TB case detection, treatment initiation, and '\", \"b'treatment completion, while also improving the sustainability and resilience of the TB program '\", \"b'at the national and provincial/district levels. This will require delivery of equitable TB services '\", \"b'that take into account people-centered and cost-effective approaches that address major '\", \"b'barriers to accessing quality TB services that are inclusive, combat stigma and discrimination, '\", \"b'address gender related challenges, and promote innovative approaches to improve TB control.  '\", \"b'Activities under the Accelerating Elimination of Tuberculosis in Indonesia APS will aim to fulfill '\", \"b'the goal by contributing to one or more of the program\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s seven objectives.  '\", \"b'1. Enhanced capacity for TB case finding  '\", \"b'10 Strategi Penanggulangan Tuberkulosis di Indonesia 2020-2024, Kementerian Kesehatan Republik Indonesia, 2020 '\", \"b'11WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2021  '\", \"b'7 '\", \"b'Annual Program Statement  '\", \"b'Accelerating Elimination of TB in Indonesia '\", \"b'Substantial gaps between the estimated TB incidence and case notifications have resulted in a '\", \"b'considerable proportion of missing TB cases in Indonesia. Exclusively relying on passive case '\", \"b'finding is insufficient to detect TB patients who do not seek care at health facilities. '\", \"b'Additionally, several behavioral and societal factors contribute to poor case detection among '\", \"b'women. This includes inability to access services due to financial barriers and stigma from '\", \"b'community members. Furthermore, while women globally tend to seek care earlier than men '\", \"b'do, they often delay diagnosis and treatment longer suggesting that tailored programing must '\", \"b'be put in place to address the issue. '\", \"b'Limited access to services for vulnerable populations, such as children, residents living in urban '\", \"b'slums, and those in remote areas pose additional challenges to TB case finding. Furthermore, '\", \"b'the absence of active efforts to reach vulnerable populations hinders acceleration of early case '\", \"b'detection and increases risk of transmission to larger communities, leading to unfavorable '\", \"b'outcomes. The global TB community consistently promotes Active Case Finding (ACF) to identify '\", \"b'TB cases beyond or outside of health facilities. A few small scale ACF interventions have been '\", \"b'implemented in different settings in Indonesia but introducing an innovative approach to ACF '\", 'b\"that is tailored to Indonesia\\'s varied geographical and cultural context remains important. \"', \"b'USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gender analysis recommends that it is important to have strategies in enabling TB case '\", \"b'finding among vulnerable groups in urban and hard- to- reach areas. This focus, however, will '\", \"b'need to be developed in addition to but not as a replacement of cost-effective facility-based '\", \"b'interventions to systematically find and link TB cases to care. Additionally, supporting ongoing '\", \"b'activities to investigate TB exposure among close contacts of active TB patients through contact '\", \"b'investigation remains essential. This includes conducting contact investigation in congregate '\", \"b'settings with high TB transmission risk, such as workplaces, mines, boarding schools, and etc. '\", \"b'This initiative would also be key to respond to persistent challenges in finding childhood TB '\", \"b'cases in Indonesia. Additionally, assistance in pursuing an integrated model of TB case finding '\", \"b'with other health priorities to ensure early diagnosis and continuity of care requires more '\", \"b'focused attention. '\", \"b'2. Improved quality of TB screening and diagnosis  '\", \"b'Global policies require universal access to rapid diagnostic tests for all new and relapse TB '\", \"b'patients. Typically, patients are diagnosed after they show signs of symptoms, however this '\", \"b'could result in delayed diagnosis as according to the latest TB Prevalence Survey, as many as '\", \"b'40%12 of those with bacteriologically confirmed TB in Indonesia do not have specific TB '\", \"b'12 Indonesia TB Prevalence Survey, 2014 '\", \"b'8 '\", \"b'Annual Program Statement  '\", \"b'Accelerating Elimination of TB in Indonesia '\", \"b'symptoms. Therefore, there is a need for effective screening tools and strategies to identify '\", \"b'asymptomatic TB. Furthermore, men have a higher burden of disease, leading to a reported 2.3 '\", \"b'male-to-female ratio for bacteriologically confirmed adult TB cases. However, despite having '\", \"b'more TB cases among men, men are very often missing from the TB continuum of care, thus a '\", \"b'specific approach is needed to ensure effective screening practices and strategies are designed '\", \"b'and tailored to men. '\", \"b'Due to low bacilli counts and difficulties detecting TB bacteria in children, special attention is '\", \"b'also needed to improve existing and to introduce new diagnostic tools. Improving TB '\", \"b'diagnostics and screening for all patients will require a reliable, well-organized, and effectively '\", \"b'operated diagnostic network that involves all levels of the TB laboratory hierarchy and ensures '\", \"b'a strong quality assurance system is in place. The main focus of the response to the '\", \"b'aforementioned challenges should be improving the availability of feasible and scalable '\", \"b'diagnostic approaches across the full spectrum of TB care and the health system. '\", \"b'In addition to identifying people with active TB disease, Indonesia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s NSP has set ambitious goals '\", \"b'to improve TB preventive treatment (TPT) coverage, and for that reason TB infection testing '\", \"b'remains a priority. To respond to this challenge, more efforts should be made to introduce and '\", \"b'adopt existing and novel TB infection diagnostic tools, methods, and techniques.  '\", \"b'3. Improved quality of TB service delivery '\", \"b'Recognizing the significant need for applying a patient-centered model in achieving universal '\", \"b'access to quality TB care in all sectors (both public and private), USAID envisions leveraging the '\", \"b'use of digital adherence monitoring tools, provision of social and psychological support, and '\", \"b'provision of mental health counseling to TB patients.  '\", \"b'Continued efforts to promote private sector engagement also remains essential for Indonesia\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'TB program. Future private sector engagement in TB should explore the opportunity to '\", \"b'leverage the private sector\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s potential to deliver integrated DS- and DR-TB care. At the same '\", \"b'time, it is important to strengthen the quality of healthcare in the public sector by integrating '\", \"b'TB care across other related health priorities.  '\", \"b'Despite innovations in DR-TB diagnosis and treatment over the past decade, addressing DR-TB '\", \"b'in Indonesia remains a challenge. Over the past several years, a number of essential '\", \"b'programmatic gaps have persisted such as high rates of initial lost-to-follow up, poor treatment '\", \"b'adherence, and low treatment success rates for both adults and children. Furthermore, '\", \"b'negative stigma associated with TB as well as the lack of necessary legal identity documents to '\", \"b'9 '\", \"b'Annual Program Statement  '\", \"b'Accelerating Elimination of TB in Indonesia '\", \"b'access health services or to enroll in health insurance for Key Affected Populations (KAPs) and '\", \"b'Persons with a Disability, are additional barriers to TB testing and treatment. This signifies the '\", \"b'urgent need to improve the quality of DR-TB management, including but not limited to the '\", \"b'scalable uptake and introduction of novel short-all oral regimens to increase treatment '\", \"b'coverage while improving treatment results for all TB patients and promoting patient-centered '\", \"b'care as the fundamental principle in managing TB care.  '\", \"b'4. Prevention of TB optimized '\", \"b'Effective management of TB Infection is essential to control the TB epidemic and prevent TB '\", \"b'infection from progressing to active disease. Timely and appropriate TB prevention along with '\", \"b'contact investigation should be a fundamental part of a national activity targeting screening of '\", \"b'people who are at high risk for developing TB in the community, and other settings such as '\", \"b'workplaces, prisons, and religious boarding schools to address the underlying clinical and risk '\", \"b'factors for TB progression. For people with high-risk of developing active TB disease, provision '\", \"b'of novel, short-course TPT regimens is crucial.  '\", \"b'There is a need to support a broader range of prevention activities, including: strengthening '\", \"b'targeted screening for active TB among high-risk individuals and groups, including healthcare '\", \"b'workers; improving infection control interventions to prevent transmission in healthcare '\", \"b'facilities and other congregate settings; and screening for and treatment of TBI to reduce the '\", \"b'risk of progression to active TB among individuals with or at greatest risk to develop TB. '\", \"b'For the above purposes, a strong strategy for the development and dissemination of '\", \"b'information and education on TB prevention and care has to be in place for use across all '\", \"b'sectors.  '\", \"b'Ending TB calls for innovative tools and strategies over the whole TB cascade, e.g., sensitive '\", \"b'diagnostic tools, the most effective regimens for treating TB, and efficacious TB vaccines. At the '\", \"b'global level, several potential vaccine candidates against TB are currently under development, '\", \"b'and there is increasing confidence that a new TB vaccine will become available in the coming '\", 'b\"years. It will be important to anticipate this promising lifesaving approach, ensuring Indonesia\\'s \"', \"b'readiness in adopting and deploying a new TB vaccine.  '\", \"b'5. Strong and resilient health system to accelerate TB elimination  '\", \"b'USAID recognizes that both specific disease programs and larger health initiatives could benefit '\", \"b'from a strong and resilient health system. USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s TB activities will translate this Health System '\", \"b'Strengthening vision (HSS) into sustainable strategies towards achieving the desired '\", \"b'10 '\", \"b'Annual Program Statement  '\", \"b'Accelerating Elimination of TB in Indonesia '\", \"b'intermediate results of equity, quality, and resources optimization. For this purpose, strategic '\", \"b'yet practical approaches are needed to strengthen the National TB Program\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s capacity to meet '\", \"b'those three intermediate outcomes across the traditional elements of HSS: service delivery, '\", \"b'human resources, health information systems, access to essential medicines, and financing and '\", \"b'governance. This will eventually lead to improved performance of the health system, which will '\", \"b'advance TB elimination. '\", \"b'Successful TB management requires strengthening of the entire health system, which includes '\", \"b'ensuring there is a strong system in forecasting, procurement, and supply chains for TB drugs '\", \"b'and commodities; existence of a national health information system that effectively and '\", \"b'efficiently records and reports TB cases and related deaths; utilization of information generated '\", \"b'by the system to inform decision making at all levels; improvement in mobilizing, distributing, '\", \"b'and building up the capacity of dedicated human resources in the TB program, especially at the '\", \"b'primary health care level, where providers spearhead TB services in Indonesia; and sustaining '\", \"b'funding for reducing the TB burden. '\", \"b'Robust HSS also requires the ability to rapidly respond to the emerging and acute crises that '\", 'b\"significantly threaten the country\\'s efforts in combating TB. The COVID-19 pandemic generated \"', \"b'mounting evidence that the co-occurrence of prominent diseases has a profound effect on '\", \"b'worsening TB outcomes. Understanding that the dynamic health security context at both the '\", \"b'global and country levels have the potential to severely disrupt TB programs, a resilient health '\", \"b'system is vital. The country must have the flexibility to adapt and adjust policies and resources '\", \"b'to respond to disease threats, while maintaining the system\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s functionality in delivering quality '\", \"b'TB service and meeting the 2030 TB elimination targets. '\", \"b'All of the above are key elements that must be considered to meet the needs of diverse '\", \"b'communities at risk. This requires execution of strategic interventions that address major '\", \"b'barriers to rapid adoption of the global and national TB strategies, development and '\", \"b'implementation of evidence-informed policy, bolder multi-sectoral commitment in TB '\", \"b'prevention and care, service uptake by communities at greater risk of TB, and social inclusion in '\", \"b'TB case management.  '\", \"b'In order to support the government of Indonesia in implementing gender responsive TB '\", \"b'prevention and care across the health system, the activity will improve gender awareness '\", \"b'among stakeholders through gender integration workshops, so the TB programs are tailored to '\", \"b'the specific needs of different genders and so that everyone has equal access to and benefit '\", \"b'from TB services. In Indonesia, District health offices are responsible for developing yearly '\", \"b'program plans, with support for budget planning from regional and national level planning '\", \"b'11 '\", \"b'Annual Program Statement  '\", \"b'Accelerating Elimination of TB in Indonesia '\", \"b'agencies. Improving gender awareness among these stakeholders can increase their awareness '\", \"b'on how to use gender lens in program planning and implementation can help them better '\", \"b'respond to local gender-related TB needs. '\", \"b'6. Community participation in implementing development activities strengthened  '\", \"b'A successful TB program requires both the government and community to actively take '\", \"b'responsibility in planning, implementing, and monitoring TB control activities. USAID envisages '\", \"b'greater engagement of the community in TB programs beyond their traditional role as the '\", \"b'primary beneficiaries. Communities must be involved in shaping policy on patient-centered '\", \"b'programs, delivering quality community-based TB care, and advancing the community\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'potential in other TB management roles. By acknowledging the fundamental role of the '\", \"b'community, USAID recognizes that stronger partnership and collaboration between key TB '\", \"b'stakeholders and communities is imperative. Activities will need to support regulation and '\", \"b'resources for broader community involvement in TB programs and combat challenges. For '\", \"b'example, women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lesser inclusion due to traditional gender roles that assign women to '\", \"b'household labor and caregiving duties that may prevent them from participating in community '\", \"b'engagement activities are among key concerns.  '\", \"b'In line with the USAID Local Capacity Strengthening Policy, this activity will support and work in '\", \"b'partnership with local actors and networks to lead achievement of their own development '\", \"b'goals. The activity will work with local partners to provide capacity strengthening support that '\", \"b'is tailored to the Indonesian context and reflects local partners desires and needs. While the '\", \"b'support provided through this activity will improve the ability of local organizations, including '\", \"b'those representing vulnerable groups, to lead USAID-funded projects, the ultimate goal is to '\", \"b'improve these organizations capabilities to implement development activities as a whole '\", \"b'beyond USAID. This includes improving organizations capacity in areas such as gender-'\", \"b'responsive TB programming, organizational, and financial management. This activity will also '\", \"b'promote various approaches such as improving the capability of organizations to access local '\", \"b'government budgets and other budget sources at the sub-national level, as well as leveraging '\", \"b'private sector funding/co-investment in Indonesia. '\", \"b'7. TB implementation research to improve TB control  '\", \"b'Operational research provides the required evidence-based knowledge to support NTP in '\", \"b'planning and rolling out strategic interventions in an efficient manner, which is important to '\", \"b'meet TB targets. Although operational research has been more frequently undertaken in '\", \"b'Indonesia in the past few years, little is known about its expected impact on the broader TB '\", \"b'12 '\", \"b'Annual Program Statement  '\", \"b'Accelerating Elimination of TB in Indonesia '\", \"b'control program. To meet 2030 TB elimination targets, TB control activities need to be available '\", \"b'across the country and operate at high standards. This is where the operational research role '\", \"b'comes in as a guide for improving TB program performance through proven problem-solving '\", \"b'approaches or by adding new knowledge to the TB field. Therefore, it is important to ensure '\", \"b'that identified gaps in delivering TB control programs are addressed through reliable strategies, '\", \"b'namely those resulting from relevant but feasible operational research that results in greater '\", \"b'use of OR to inform NTP policy and the scale up of evidenced-based interventions within the '\", \"b'Indonesia context, including but not limited to minimizing the gap in data availability for how '\", \"b'women and disadvantaged groups participate in health systems and access needed health '\", \"b'services and information, as well as gender data on treatment coverage. '\", \"b'Expected Results: '\", \"b'The Accelerating Elimination of Tuberculosis in Indonesia APS aims to contribute to an overall '\", \"b'decline in TB incidence, prevalence, and mortality in Indonesia. Specific expected results will be '\", \"b'described in each addendum issued under the APS.  '\", \"b'E.

The expected activity result is a relevant, '\", \"b'active, resilient, and inclusive civil society sector that more effectively fosters change towards an '\", \"b'increasingly equitable and democratic Iraq. '\", \"b'The Iraq Civil Society Activity (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d) has three main objectives: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Objective 1:   Increase the engagement and agency of citizens, especially women and '\", \"b'youth, to actively contribute to positive change on shared citizen-identified priorities, as '\", \"b'well as on priority sectors, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, and '\", \"b'gender and youth inclusion. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Objective 2:  Increase sustainability and resilience of civil society organizations (CSOs) '\", \"b'to represent citizens\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 interests and advance community-led development. '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Objective 3: Strengthen a public sphere that fosters the active and inclusive participation '\", \"b'of civil society in public discourse and citizen-driven change, including among '\", \"b'marginalized groups. '\", \"b'Background: '\", \"b'USAID partners with Iraq in its transition to a stable, democratic state. This transition has been '\", \"b'challenged by persistent conflict, entrenched elites, a culture of corruption, and civil society '\", \"b'organizations struggling to effectively play their role as a bridge between Iraq\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s people and its '\", \"b'government. '\", \"b'Iraq\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s citizens seeking change have taken to the streets in successive protest movements '\", \"b'beginning in 2015 and reaching a fever pitch in 2019. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe constitution guarantees freedom of '\", \"b'assembly, but protesters are frequently at risk of violence or arrest, and these dangers became '\", \"b'acute during the 2019 protest movement.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Recent polling across the region has indicated a '\", \"b'waning public support for \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdemocracy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and general indifference to outright support for more '\", \"b'authoritarian approaches to governance1.  '\", \"b'Support for civic action and increased, more effective, and credible civil society engagement is '\", \"b'the primary mechanism for countering this loss of hope and channeling the frustration into more '\", \"b'positive pathways for change. Iraqi civil society requires additional support to represent citizens\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 '\", \"b'interests and effect change. While street protest movements and elections are important channels '\", \"b'for citizens seeking change, citizens have other avenues that are currently underutilized and '\", \"b'underdeveloped. Young Iraqis who led the protest movements in 2019 have remained active in '\", \"b'their communities, focusing on issues of environment, community development, and government '\", \"b'1 https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-62001426 '\", \"b'        4 '\", \"b'NOFO 72026723RFA00001 '\", \"b'         Iraq Civil Society Activity '\", \"b'accountability, and capitalizing on that energy through direct support to civic actors provides '\", \"b'USAID an opportunity to mitigate democratic backsliding in Iraq, as well as advance sectoral '\", \"b'priorities. '\", \"b'However, Iraqi civil society has limited capacity to make this change. In addition, funding from '\", \"b'USAID has been reduced and targeted in other areas in recent years.  The last USAID country-'\", \"b'wide civil society specific award was from 2012-2015. This paralleled a reduction in donor funds '\", \"b'for all activities in Iraq, including civil society. From 2014 to date, most funding for civil society '\", \"b'has focused on the distribution of humanitarian aid, stabilization programming, and some '\", \"b'reconciliation work in select geographic areas. Very little of the current available funding '\", \"b'includes CSO institutional capacity or organizational resilience building support, advocacy skills '\", \"b'building, or support to CSO networking. There has been little funding for CSOs for other critical '\", \"b'skills that help develop legitimacy, such as developing and engaging with constituencies to '\", \"b'support their missions, increasing citizen engagement to make sustainable changes in public life, '\", \"b'engaging the government, and networking.  '\", \"b'Additionally, while the role of civil society has grown since 2003, the government has recently '\", \"b'restricted space for civil society. In addition, citizen engagement in public life and/or '\", \"b'constructive interaction with government is at a minimum; and, in recent elections, even voter '\", \"b'turnout fell notably. Citizens need more access to information and there is a dearth of '\", \"b'opportunities for constructive citizen-government dialogue.  If access to information and dialog '\", \"b'is increased, trust by the government in the role of civil society and its vital role in democratic '\", \"b'governance will improve.   '\", \"b'Activity Problem Statement: '\", \"b'Iraqi civil society has suffered shocks and stressors that have limited its capacity and resilience '\", \"b'to effectively aggregate, network, and represent the interests of all citizens and limited citizen '\", \"b'engagement in the public sphere. Donors\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 shifting priorities to shorter-term programming, '\", \"b'particularly humanitarian assistance, broke early, post-2003 momentum in the growth of CSOs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 '\", \"b'advocacy, networking, and ability to foster change, and left Iraq\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s CSOs with a credibility '\", \"b'problem due to a perception the organizations lacked focus and simply chased funds. Although '\", \"b'some organizations have survived shifting funding priorities and political winds, it is clear that '\", 'b\"without an active civil society, gaps in citizens\\' understanding, skills, and avenues necessary to \"', \"b'pursue positive change through the public sphere other than protest movements and elections '\", \"b'have grown. As such, reinvigorated work with civil society to generate interest in and lay the '\", \"b'groundwork for more citizen participation is necessary for civic initiatives to effectively '\", \"b'represent citizen needs and hold the government accountable. '\", \"b'Marginalization of specific population groups further contributes to eroding trust in '\", \"b'government.  These groups include women and girls, youth and religious/ethnic '\", \"b'minorities.  Marginalized groups are increasingly and systematically excluded from government '\", \"b'and decision making, both locally and at the national level. Although mitigated by the fall of '\", \"b'Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), these groups still face physical insecurity and '\", \"b'disenfranchisement.  '\", \"b'As outlined in USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gender analysis released as part of a May 2022 Request for Information, '\", \"b'Iraqi women and girls face particular challenges stemming from years of disenfranchisement and '\", \"b'marginalization.  Their role in civil society has been a bright spot in terms of political '\", \"b'participation, leadership, and engagement.  However, challenges remain, including online '\", \"b'harassment and physical threats, particularly for women representing minority groups or working '\", \"b'in more conservative areas of the country.  Lack of appropriate legal frameworks or '\", \"b'        5 '\", \"b'NOFO 72026723RFA00001 '\", \"b'         Iraq Civil Society Activity '\", \"b'implementation of existing legal protections hinders full female participation in civic life.  The '\", \"b'cycle of protests that began in October 2019 featured women not just as participants but as '\", \"b'leaders in the movement. Through their participation, women focused attention on issues of '\", \"b'equal access to social and economic justice. For the first time in current history, women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voices '\", \"b'on these issues were not only raised, but raised in an organized and forceful manner.  However, '\", \"b'this momentum needs to be followed through and combined with support from the broader '\", \"b'community, particularly men, to ensure calls for change are realized. '\", \"b'Youth in Iraq have played a key role in civic action, including leading protests, and calling for '\", \"b'widespread reform to improve governance, the rule of law, employment opportunities, and '\", \"b'access to public services. With nearly 60 percent of the population under the age of 25, this '\", \"b'demographic represents one of the largest age groups in Iraq. Unfortunately, this population '\", \"b'remains systematically excluded from politics, and have experienced significant trauma from '\", \"b'conflict and the breakdown of traditional, societal frameworks. Across the country, young people '\", \"b'are disillusioned and mistrustful of political institutions, in particular local/municipal '\", \"b'government bodies. In a 2021 USAID survey, only 6 percent of young people surveyed (nearly '\", \"b'800 across the country) said they trusted local government.2 Moreover, only 30 percent of '\", \"b'respondents believed their community was supportive of young people participating in local '\", \"b'politics. Despite these statistics, young people remain engaged. In the same survey, 55 percent '\", \"b'noted that they had contacted a local official at least once.  This is a high level of engagement '\", \"b'when compared to other countries in the region, such as Lebanon, where only 30 percent of '\", \"b'youth made contact. A whole-of-community approach is critical for strengthening the enabling '\", \"b'environment and support for young people in Iraq to participate in civic and political life, and be '\", \"b'critical agents of change to help move an issue from protest to policy. '\", \"b'Given the political environment in Iraq since 2019, civil society has a unique opportunity to '\", \"b'engage the government, particularly at the local level, on issues of critical interest to Iraqi '\", \"b'citizens including reliable public services, prudent and impartial governance, and an end to '\", \"b'corruption.  Thematic issues such as environment/climate change, gender based violence and '\", \"b'community development are other areas of concern to Iraqis that throughout USAID '\", \"b'consultations in support of the design of this program were expressed consistently by existing '\", \"b'civil society organizations and community leaders.   Marginalized groups are increasingly and '\", \"b'systematically excluded from government and decision making both locally and at the national '\", \"b'level.  Although the fall of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) led to a more stable security '\", \"b'situation in the country, citizens and particularly marginalized citizens still face physical '\", \"b'insecurity and disenfranchisement.

'\", \"b'The theory of change is as follows:  '\", \"b'IF civic initiatives, especially with marginalized communities, effectively engage and empower '\", \"b'citizens to identify, prioritize, advocate for, and contribute to shared priorities of their '\", \"b'communities; AND  '\", \"b'IF civil society is more capable and resilient and CSOs work together more effectively to '\", \"b'inclusively represent citizen interests '\", \"b'THEN civic initiatives more accurately reflect citizen needs; '\", \"b'AND CSOs will have broader citizen support and increased credibility to advocate for change in '\", \"b'accordance with local priorities; '\", \"b'Administrator Power has emphasized \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clocalization\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as a priority for USAID programming across '\", \"b'sectors.  USAID has defined \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clocalization\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d along four principal lines of effort that include '\", \"b'channeling a larger portion of funding directly to local civil society, business, and other '\", \"b'institutions that are supported by and accountable to local communities. The Agency has a '\", \"b'mandate to shift not only funding but also to put local partners in the lead to co-design projects, '\", \"b'set priorities, drive implementation, and evaluate impact of aid programs. Grounded in these '\", \"b'principles, the Iraq Civil Society Activity has 3 defined objectives:   '\", \"b'Objective 1:   Increase the engagement and agency of citizens, especially women and youth, '\", \"b'to actively contribute to positive change on shared citizen-identified priorities. '\", \"b'Under Objective 1, the Expected Results of the Activity are: '\", \"b'1. Improved civic knowledge and practices that help citizens forge a shared vision of '\", \"b'democratic processes and how to use them to seek change. '\", \"b'2. Increased women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s participation and leadership in civil society, and the amplification of '\", \"b'their voices. '\", \"b'3. Increased participation of targeted marginalized groups, including youth, in civil society, '\", \"b'and the amplification of their voices. '\", \"b'Under this objective, the Activity will increase the ability of individual citizens, and informal '\", \"b'citizens\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 groups not organized as registered CSOs, to engage productively in public life, '\", \"b'including identifying local challenges and providing suggested solutions. The Activity will give '\", \"b'citizens a better understanding of how they can improve their local communities through locally '\", \"b'driven approaches to identifying, addressing, and sustaining citizen initiatives. There is a natural '\", \"b'overlap between this objective and objective 2 in that the Recipient will engage Iraqi CSOs to act '\", \"b'as implementing agents/partners and leaders in this community-driven work stream, from design '\", \"b'through to monitoring and evaluation phases.  '\", \"b'Objective 2:  Increase sustainability and resilience of civil society organizations (CSOs) to '\", \"b'represent citizens\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 interests and advance community-led development. '\", \"b'Under Objective 2, the Expected Results of the Activity are: '\", \"b'1. CSOs more effectively network and build coalitions to improve advocacy and '\", \"b'institutional effectiveness.

CSOs increasingly hold local and national policymakers accountable through new and '\", \"b'creative approaches that mobilize citizen engagement. '\", \"b'3. CSOs are able to advocate effectively to create positive change on behalf of their '\", \"b'constituents. '\", \"b'4. CSOs are increasingly able to adapt to Iraq\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dynamic context and adjust their approaches '\", \"b'to adapt to challenges like climate change, gender equality setbacks, and/or changes in '\", \"b'their operating environment.  '\", \"b'Under this objective, the Activity will increase the skills of CSOs to mobilize citizens and build '\", \"b'constituencies around issues of shared interest as well as more effectively lead advocacy '\", \"b'campaigns for change, which will simultaneously enhance their ability to network with one '\", \"b'another to amplify their voices and those of the citizens they represent.  Much work has '\", \"b'previously been done to develop the capacity of CSOs in Iraq; however, this Activity must '\", \"b'employ a new approach of building CSO networks that are:  focused on specific activities/issues; '\", \"b'build the capacity of their members in line with USAID Capacity Building 2.0 approach3; and '\", \"b'seek to build longer-term sustainability. The Activity will build systematic capacity that goes '\", \"b'beyond just administrative, financial, and procurement systems, but digs deeper into monitoring, '\", \"b'evaluation, learning (MEL), strategy development, fundraising, strategic communications, '\", \"b'advocacy, and organizational resilience-building capacities. This broadened approach will allow '\", \"b'CSOs to better weather unexpected shocks to the external environment. '\", \"b'Under this objective, the Activity will create and implement a demand-driven small, sub-grants '\", \"b'component valued at $1 million annually to enable local sustainability, and shift more leadership, '\", \"b'ownership, decision-making, and implementation to local groups. A co-creation and co-design '\", \"b'process that includes the implementing partner/s, USAID and other stakeholders as required and '\", \"b'will include joint development of focus and themes regarding calls for proposals, consultation '\", \"b'with local partners and review of proposals, is anticipated. In line with USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s emphasis on '\", \"b'localization, the Activity will support the organic and locally led priorities of Iraq\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s CSOs '\", \"b'through these small sub-grants while also presenting opportunities to address specific issues and '\", \"b'priorities important to USAID, including but not limited to climate change, transparency, '\", \"b'accountability, gender inclusion, and youth inclusion. The sub-grants component will not include '\", \"b'funds for renovation, rehabilitation, or construction related activities.  '\", \"b'Objective 3: Strengthen a public sphere that fosters the active and inclusive participation '\", \"b'of civil society in public discourse and citizen-driven change, including among '\", \"b'marginalized groups. '\", \"b'Under Objective 3, the Expected Results of the Activity are: '\", \"b'1. Improved timely and reliable access to information by citizens, including through digital '\", \"b'technologies, resulting from CSO and citizen advocacy. '\", \"b'2. Increased use of public information by civil society and marginalized groups to inform '\", \"b'citizens and increase government transparency. '\", \"b'3. Greater public understanding of the role of civil society and CSOs in democratic '\", \"b'governance. '\", \"b'4.

The Activity will support CSO\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in developing coherent and '\", 'b\"effective communication strategies that lead to enhanced public understanding of citizens\\' role in \"', \"b'governance as well as the role of civil society in supporting civic action for better governance to '\", \"b'improve the perception and credibility of Iraqi civil society. Expected result 4, focused on '\", \"b'increased opportunities for citizen-government interaction presents a natural overlap with '\", \"b'USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s governance-focused activities and requires the Activity to collaborate closely with that '\", \"b'implementing partner. Under this Activity however, USAID is focused on CSO-driven and '\", \"b'citizen-driven approaches to engagement with government and technical approaches to '\", \"b'increasing opportunities for this interaction, especially considering the violence citizens have '\", \"b'experienced and witnessed during the street protest movements.  '\", \"b'Programming Approach - Refine And Implement/Inception Phase '\", \"b'As the situation on the ground in Iraq continues to be dynamic, new challenges or new '\", \"b'opportunities arise regularly, and may arise between the design and launch of this activity. The '\", \"b'nature of the Iraqi environment requires shorter planning cycles, active monitoring and robust '\", \"b'feedback systems that allow managers to adapt implementation at every stage. To identify '\", \"b'challenges and allow flexibility and adaptation at an early stage of implementation, the Activity '\", \"b'must apply a Refine and Implement (R&I) approach for an initial four-month refinement '\", \"b'phase.  During this period the partner will initiate the co-creation process with USAID that will '\", \"b'characterize implementation through the life of the activity and culminate in the first year\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'implementation plan, with a draft life of activity implementation plan. USAID recommends that '\", \"b'potential applicants review and utilize USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Civil Society Assessment Tool to inform their '\", \"b'approach toward this analytical and planning phase. Furthermore, although typically an '\", \"b'implementation strategy and anticipated results established at the application stage will likely '\", \"b'differ from the time of award, in the Iraq context implementation plans may be constrained to '\", \"b'carry out what was initially envisioned. In response to this tension, a Refine and Implement '\", \"b'(R&I) approach will be applied to this activity. As such in the initial four month R&I period the '\", \"b'implementing partner can carry out an inception/refinement phase to its proposed technical, '\", \"b'implementation, and monitoring and evaluation plan, that should include a landscape analysis, '\", \"b'political economy analyses and/or other sectors or issue specific research and assessment '\", \"b'components.  The R&I period will also be extremely important to support the localization '\", \"b'approach through deep dives into communities, to identify community leaders, women-led, '\", \"b'youth-led or youth-focused, and marginalized community leaders, groups, and/or issue-focused '\", \"b'organizations with whom to partner. As USAID requires more localization in all its awards, we '\", \"b'recognize that, particularly in non-permissive environments, the necessary relationships to truly '\", \"b'localize and co-design activities in partnership with local communities, groups, leaders, and '\", \"b'CSOs, takes time. This inception phase is that time. '\", \"b'Flexible Activity Modifier Component for Rapid Response '\", \"b'This component is focused on identifying and seizing opportunities in the sector as an adaptive, '\", \"b'collaborative program management tool.  Rapid response actions must be targeted to '\", \"b'opportunities that emerge or may fill a gap in technical expertise or information required to '\", \"b'        9 '\", \"b'NOFO 72026723RFA00001 '\", \"b'         Iraq Civil Society Activity '\", \"b'achieve the objectives of the program.  This requires co-creation and collaboration with USAID '\", \"b'prior to invocation and will be initiated with agreement of USAID.  The purpose of this '\", \"b'component is to address the variabilities of the operational context in Iraq which requires '\", \"b'programmatic flexibility particularly given the volatility of the political environment.  With '\", \"b'approval of the Agreement Officer, it is envisioned this rapid response mechanism will provide '\", \"b'USAID/Iraq the ability to support leaders, movements and other emerging opportunities and '\", \"b'evolving needs within the objectives of the program.  It could also be used to scale and expand '\", \"b'efforts.  As needed and as directed by the Agreement Officer, in consultation with the USAID '\", \"b'AOR, the awardee will present unique opportunities for assistance programming related to the '\", \"b'program objectives. The cost line item will allow the release of rapid response funds to the '\", \"b'Applicant and its partners for immediate activities to seize identified opportunities. Subject to the '\", \"b'availability of additional funding, USAID may choose to invoke the activity modifier for rapid '\", \"b'response to implement additional interventions at any point in the life of the activity. Any '\", \"b'modification of the agreement is anticipated to include a process of co-creation and co-design, to '\", \"b'include joint development of concepts for the modifier alongside USAID and partners. Full '\", \"b'concepts for the modifier for rapid response activities will be developed prior to the modification '\", \"b'of the anticipated award through a revised Activity Description and detailed budget submitted by '\", \"b'the Applicant. The expenditure of funds for the activation of the modifier or rapid response '\", \"b'component, will be dependent on review and approval by the AOR and AO in consultation with '\", \"b'the MEO, of the revised Activity Description and detailed budget. '\", \"b'The topline figure to be set-aside for the program modifier is $1 million per year ($5 million total '\", \"b'under the total estimated annual cost of the program); however, USAID recognizes the fluid '\", \"b'operating environment and future modifications may be possible if they fit within the scope of '\", \"b'the defined activity objectives, are sufficiently justified and according to the availability of '\", \"b'funds. Any such modification would be at the discretion of the Agreement Officer and consider '\", \"b'regulatory and policy requirements for competition.

If youth and women continue to feel disassociated from the democratic '\", \"b'government, and are unable to secure gainful employment and/or receive a living wage, then '\", \"b'they will continue to lose confidence in Iraq\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s democratic development.  '\", \"b'Gender Inclusion: The 2020 Gender Equality and Women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Empowerment Policy affirms '\", 'b\"USAID\\'s vision of a prosperous and peaceful world in which women, girls, men, and boys enjoy \"', \"b'equal economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights and are equally empowered to secure '\", \"b'better lives for themselves, their families, their communities, and their countries. Advancing '\", \"b'gender equality is at the core of USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s efforts to promote greater stability and prosperity, and '\", \"b'support a more transparent and participatory democratic process in Iraq. The Recipient must '\", \"b'systematically consider gender aspects and implications of specific interventions and seek '\", \"b'opportunities to promote women participation in targeted interventions. To that end, data '\", \"b'collected for monitoring and evaluation purposes must be gender disaggregated and other '\", \"b'monitoring and evaluation tools, including surveys, must include questions to elicit information '\", \"b'enabling differentiation of impact based on gender.

To further sustain the outcomes of this '\", \"b'Activity and foster local ownership, interventions should not only focus on building and '\", \"b'strengthening the capacity of local partner CSOs, but also fostering the motivation to utilize the '\", \"b'new knowledge, skills, and the benefits of broader collaboration and coordination. Additionally, '\", \"b'the Recipient is required to work with local partners to understand their legal parameters and '\", \"b'maximize the resources available to them through networking to continue and build on the '\", \"b'interventions beyond the life of the Activity.

The Recipient will assume responsibility for administering Federal '\", \"b'funds in a manner consistent with underlying agreements, program objectives, and the terms and '\", \"b'conditions of the Federal award. The Recipient, using its own unique combination of staff, '\", \"b'facilities, and experience, has the primary responsibility for employing whatever form of sound '\", \"b'organization and management techniques may be necessary in order to assure proper and efficient '\", \"b'administration of the resulting award. '\", \"b'8. Selection of Instrument '\", \"b'        14 '\", \"b'NOFO 72026723RFA00001 '\", \"b'         Iraq Civil Society Activity '\", \"b'Beginning in February 2022, USAID conducted a series of consultations with Iraq\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s non-state '\", \"b'actors, CSOs, formal and informal groups, as well as other donors and international '\", \"b'implementing organizations operating in the sector. The outcome of the consultations and '\", \"b'corresponding analysis of both consultations, research documents, data, and other information '\", \"b'was the development of the concept for the new Civil Society Activity. The elements of this '\", \"b'concept support that the Agency\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s programmatic needs would be best met by providing funds '\", \"b'and/or in-kind support to an implementing organization, where the primary beneficiary is the '\", \"b'recipient organization, who then provides a benefit to third party civil society organizations '\", \"b'throughout Iraq.  The activity will require a flexible approach as it will prioritize '\", \"b'experimentation, particularly when supporting any newly emerging civic groups or movements, '\", \"b'exploring new ways of supporting existing groups and networks, as well as seeking sustainable '\", \"b'funding models that are specific to the Iraq context.  Critical to the activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s success will be co-'\", \"b'creation approaches and bringing together a wide range of stakeholders to jointly define '\", \"b'problems and brainstorm solutions. Given the nature of work with informal entities and groups '\", \"b'of citizens seeking to organize around common goals, USAID support should be provided '\", \"b'through an assistance mechanism. USAID intends to provide funds to an eligible organization '\", \"b'that has experience in the civil society sector. '\", \"b'We are not seeking to contract for supplies or services to be provided to USAID for its direct use '\", \"b'or benefit therefore an acquisition mechanism is not appropriate. The principal purpose of the '\", \"b'Assistance instrument is to transfer Federal financial assistance to the recipient to carry out in the '\", \"b'designated program. '\", \"b'9. Other Information '\", \"b'Award will be made to a responsible Applicant(s) whose Application best meets the requirements '\", \"b'of this NOFO and the merit review criteria contained herein. Issuance of this NOFO does not '\", \"b'constitute an award commitment on the part of the Government, nor does it commit the '\", \"b'Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of an Application. In '\", \"b'addition, final award of any resultant award cannot be made until funds have been fully '\", \"b'appropriated, allocated, and committed through internal USAID procedures. While it is anticipated '\", \"b'that these procedures will be successfully completed, the potential applicant is hereby notified of '\", \"b'these requirements and conditions for award. The Application is submitted at the risk of the '\", 'b\"Applicant; all preparation and submission costs are at the Applicant\\'s expense.  \"', \"b'[END OF SECTION B] '\", \"b'THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE LEFT BLANK INTENTIONALLY '\", \"b'        15 '\", \"b'NOFO 72026723RFA00001 '\", \"b'         Iraq Civil Society Activity '\", \"b'1.

'\", \"b'Note: Applicants who submit using non-secure methods of transmission do so at their own '\", \"b'risk. '\", \"b'c. Selection proceeds separately from vetting. Vetting is conducted independently from any '\", \"b'discussions the agreement officer may have with an applicant. The applicant and any '\", \"b'proposed subrecipient or contractor subject to vetting must not provide vetting information to '\", \"b'anyone other than the vetting official.

'\", \"b'SUMMARY    '\", \"b'USAID South Africa (USAID/SA) and the Government of South Africa (GoSA) signed the TB Partnership '\", \"b'Statement in 2019 committing to enhanced collaboration towards achieving the United Nations High Level '\", \"b'Meeting (UNHLM) targets and ending tuberculosis (TB) in South Africa by 2035. The purpose of '\", \"b'ACCELERATE - Accelerate TB Elimination and Program Resilience Activity is to support South Africa\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'efforts to achieve TB elimination through early detection, appropriate treatment and care, and prevention '\", \"b'among vulnerable populations, particularly those infected with TB, drug resistant TB (DR-TB), or TB/HIV '\", \"b'co-infection. ACCELERATE is the flagship USAID/SA TB project which comprises two separate activities '\", \"b'- ACCELERATE 1 targets technical support and interventions at the national, provincial level and in high '\", \"b'TB burden districts. ACCELERATE 2 hereinafter referred to as the Activity targets technical support and '\", \"b'interventions at the provincial, district, facility and community level in lower TB burden districts and will '\", \"b'advance overall progress towards TB elimination by fast tracking elimination in lower TB burden districts.  '\", \"b'ACCELERATE 2 also aims to expand coverage of key interventions in high TB case load facilities within '\", \"b'low burden TB districts and intensify community efforts to find, diagnose and successfully treat TB clients. '\", \"b'In lower TB burden districts, more effort is required to optimize effective community and facility '\", \"b'interventions to achieve TB elimination. This is because facility case finding strategies would not yield the '\", \"b'same results compared to areas with a high TB burden and as such community-based interventions '\", \"b'contribute significantly to finding, diagnosing and successfully treating TB clients in this setting. '\", \"b'Additionally, ACCELERATE 1 and ACCELERATE 2 will collaborate and partner together to support the '\", \"b'achievement of TB elimination in South Africa. The two activities have similar objectives and performance '\", \"b'targets to be achieved in the high and low TB burden districts. These are aligned to the national strategic '\", \"b'plan, national TB strategic plan and global TB targets. '\", \"b'ACCELERATE 2 will be implemented in Free State (Mangaung and Fezile Dabi districts), Limpopo '\", \"b'(Vhembe and Sekhukhune districts), Western Cape (West Coast and Cape Winelands districts), and '\", \"b'Mpumalanga (Nkangala district).  Technical support to strengthen health systems at the provincial and '\", \"b'district levels, while advancing TB elimination, should aim to sustainably strengthen the delivery of public '\", \"b'health services, building resilience against and mitigate the negative impacts of acute infectious disease '\", \"b'epidemic in support of South Africa\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s goal to eliminate TB.   '\", \"b'A2. '\", \"b'BACKGROUND '\", \"b'1. TB Epidemiology and TB Burden in South Africa '\", \"b'South Africa faces the dual epidemics of TB and HIV and is among the eight countries that account for '\", \"b'two-thirds of the global TB cases. South Africa continues to make progress to end TB with an incidence '\", \"b'4 '\", \"b'rate of 554/100,000 in 2020 - a decline from 615/100,000 reported in 2019. A total of 208,032 TB cases '\", \"b'were notified in 2020, a decline from 222,350 reported in 2019; and a reduction from 62 to 61/100,000 was '\", 'b\"reported among HIV co-infected patients. However, South Africa\\'s fight to end TB still has challenges, \"', \"b'with the TB mortality rate among HIV negative TB patients increasing from 38/100,000 in 2019 to '\", \"b'42/100,000 in 2020. '\", \"b'South Africa also remains among countries with a high drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) burden. Despite the '\", \"b'decline in 2020 due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country still reports above 7,000 '\", \"b'laboratory confirmed cases. Furthermore, the treatment initiation rate for RR/MDR TB increased to above '\", \"b'100% compared to 67.2% in 2018. Treatment success rates for drug susceptible TB (DS-TB) increased '\", \"b'from 71% in 2018 to 77% in 2019 whilst for Rifampicin Resistance/Multidrug Resistant (RR/MDR-TB) '\", \"b'success rates are at 65% for the 2018 cohort.  '\", \"b'In 2018, South Africa1 conducted its first TB prevalence survey, which highlighted the following findings: '\", \"b'1) TB prevalence is higher in those aged 35- 44 years (1,107 per 100, 000) and the elderly aged 65 years '\", \"b'and older (1,104 per 100,000); 2) TB prevalence is higher in males compared to females, with a prevalence '\", \"b'almost 1.6 times that of females. The disproportionately high TB prevalence of TB among men has '\", \"b'previously been associated with delays in seeking care and access barriers. This emphasizes the need to '\", \"b'scale up male focused and friendly TB services in and out of the facility; 3) The estimated number of TB '\", \"b'cases was more than the cases notified in the same year. This is an important finding implying risk for '\", \"b'ongoing transmission; and 4) The largest prevalence to notification gap was in the youth aged 15-24 years '\", \"b'and in those 65 years and older. To effectively deal with the TB epidemic, this gap needs to be closed.  '\", \"b'The nexus between the South Africa HIV epidemic and the TB epidemic continues to drive high morbidity '\", \"b'and mortality in the country, with the legacy of apartheid and significant income inequality posing '\", \"b'additional challenges to the TB and HIV response.  Effectively addressing TB is an important element of '\", \"b'the U.S. Government\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (USG) and USAID/SA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s efforts to improve global health and reduce poverty. '\", \"b'2. COVID-19 Impact on TB programming in South Africa '\", \"b'The COVID-19 pandemic has reversed years of progress toward TB elimination. The first confirmed case '\", \"b'of COVID-19 in South Africa was reported on March 5, 2020. In mid-March social distancing measures, '\", \"b'including restrictions on international travel, mass gatherings and school closures, were instituted to slow '\", \"b'transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and prepare the health care system. A Level 5 national lockdown, which '\", \"b'confined all but essential workers to their dwellings and imposed severe restrictions on all non-essential '\", \"b'movement, commenced on March 27, 2021. The implementation of Level 5 restrictions resulted in a sudden '\", \"b'and dramatic drop in laboratory investigations for TB across all South Africa\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s provinces. In September '\", \"b'2020, a report from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) estimated that 308,000 fewer '\", \"b'TB GeneXpert tests were conducted, and 17,700 fewer positive samples detected, between the beginning '\", \"b'of April and end of July because of COVID-19. The timing and scale of the decrease in testing volumes '\", \"b'1 The survey was conducted jointly by the South African National Department of Health TB Programme; the South '\", \"b'African Medical Research Council; the Human Sciences Research Council; the National Institute for Communicable '\", \"b'Diseases; and the World Health Organization.  '\", \"b'5 '\", \"b'were consistent across provinces and preceded the rapid rise in COVID-19 cases2. The sustained declines '\", \"b'are likely the result of reduced access to health services resulting from lockdown conditions. The increase '\", \"b'in the GeneXpert positivity rate suggests that people with mild TB symptoms delayed seeking care. '\", \"b'COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact TB detection and care and treatment for years to come.3 '\", \"b'3. South Africa\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s National Response to End TB '\", \"b'South Africa, as one of the United Nations member states, has committed to fulfilling the UN key targets '\", \"b'by 2022. The Global Plan to End TB - the Paradigm Shift (2018-2022) is intended to support the '\", \"b'achievement of the UNHLM commitment set for 2022. The country has aligned their South Africa '\", \"b'National Strategic Plan (NSP) for HIV, TB and STIs (2017-2022) and National TB Program (NTP) '\", \"b'Strategic Plan (2017-2021) to achieve the UNHLM targets and end TB by 2035, reducing TB incidence '\", \"b'and mortality rates by 90% and 95%, respectively, compared to 2015. The following TB targets are '\", \"b'outlined in the NSP: 1) Reduce TB incidence by at least 30%, from 834/100,000 population in 2015 to '\", \"b'less than 584/100,000 by 2022; 2) Identify 90% of all TB cases and place them on appropriate treatment;  '\", \"b'3) Identify at least 90% of TB cases among key populations, including people living with HIV (PLHIV) '\", \"b'and members of under-served populations; and 4) Provide successful treatment to at least 90% of those '\", \"b'diagnosed with drug-susceptible TB and 75% with drug-resistant TB4. In addition to the NSP, the NTP '\", \"b'Strategic Plan aims to use a combination-intervention approach informed by modeling of high impact '\", \"b'interventions as the approach for fast-tracking progress in TB control.

As one of two activities under ACCELERATE, the Accelerate 2 Activity will advance '\", \"b'South Africa\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s efforts toward timely achievement of TB elimination targets, as per the National Strategic '\", \"b'Plan and WHO END TB strategy. The Activity contributes to achieving Development Objective 3 of the '\", \"b'USAID/SA Regional Development Cooperation Strategy (2020-2025), which is to improve equitable '\", \"b'provision of quality health services through increased capacity to effectively manage infectious diseases.  '\", \"b'The Activity will implement a program model which provides approximately 80% technical assistance at '\", \"b'facility, district, provincial and national level. Limited direct service delivery at 20% will be provided '\", \"b'through roving teams at facility and community level to address TB, DR-TB and TB/HIV programmatic '\", \"b'gaps.

'\", \"b'Interventions which are not yet current practice in South Africa will be implemented through operational '\", \"b'research in collaboration with the Department of Health. Applicants should present approaches and '\", \"b'solutions that will advance sustainable progress to reduce the impact of TB in South Africa and achieve TB '\", \"b'elimination. The Activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s objectives and intended results are as follows: '\", \"b'5 See Section A.4 for details on geographic coverage and target populations. '\", \"b'8 '\", \"b'District-level interventions will work with District Health Management Teams (DHMT), supported by TB '\", \"b'Coordinators, to ensure implementation of TB control activities at health facilities in accordance with the '\", \"b'national policies and guidelines and collect and report data on TB program indicators to the province. The '\", \"b'Activity will support the DHMT and facility staff to implement tailored approaches in line with the GoSA '\", \"b'policies and improve TB prevention and care. Working with clinical and data staff at health facilities, the '\", \"b'Activity will increase the availability and use of quality patient-level data by strengthening TB information '\", \"b'systems, which may include introducing technologies or innovations for improved data collection, analysis, '\", \"b'and reporting. Facility interventions will introduce and institutionalize continuous quality improvement '\", \"b'processes that enable health facilities to improve patients\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 clinical outcomes and experiences with TB '\", \"b'services; and reduce per capita costs for TB and other health services. Using public health best practices '\", \"b'for mitigating COVID-19 and other pandemic threats on the health system, the Activity will also support '\", \"b'districts and health facilities to develop strategies to ensure the continuity of TB services in line with GoSA '\", \"b'guidance and the WHO COVID-19 Considerations for Tuberculosis (TB) Care. Interventions may include, '\", \"b'for instance, strategies that promote virtual care, digital health and community monitoring of TB patients. '\", \"b'To further increase awareness among the general public or specific population groups about TB, and '\", \"b'empower vulnerable populations to take action, the Activity will support Advocacy, Communication and '\", \"b'Social Mobilization (ACSM) interventions.  '\", \"b'Provincial-level interventions will support the Provincial TB Directorate to ensure the implementation of '\", \"b'national policies and guidelines and coordination of the TB response within districts. Interventions will also '\", \"b'strengthen the capacity of the TB Directorate to monitor TB activities and program reporting to the National '\", \"b'TB Program (NTP).  The Activity will provide technical assistance to provinces to rapidly scale-up new '\", \"b'policy, guidelines and evidence-based interventions to improve quality of TB prevention and care using '\", \"b'quality improvement approaches. The Activity will also work to strengthen availability and use of quality '\", \"b'TB information, which may include institutionalizing processes such as TB mortality audits and TB service '\", \"b'gap analysis. As many provinces continue to adapt public health systems to mitigate the COVID-19 impact, '\", \"b'the Activity will provide technical support to promote policy and innovative service models that promote '\", \"b'the continuity of services, which could include community-based care and digital health technologies. '\", \"b'9 '\", \"b'While this Activity does not provide technical support at the national level, the Activity will work in '\", \"b'partnership with and collaborate with the ACCELERATE 1 Activity that targets technical support to high '\", \"b'TB burden districts and the national level.

To this end, WHO recommends '\", \"b'the use of a standardized electronic active surveillance system to ensure systematic data collection and to '\", \"b'19 '\", \"b'simplify the analysis of drug safety information. USAID is currently supporting the National Department '\", \"b'of Health to integrate the electronic pharmacovigilance monitoring system (PViMS) tool into EDRWeb and '\", \"b'improve reporting of adverse events (AEs). Building on this support, this Activity will continue training '\", \"b'the users of PViMS to improve reporting of AEs; provide feedback to facilities and institutionalize the use '\", \"b'of reports on AEs; support facilities to use data from PViMS to follow up on management of ADRs; and '\", \"b'provide periodic updates and training on the upgrades made on PViMS. These interventions will be '\", \"b'implemented in collaboration with the National Affordable Medicines Directorate. '\", \"b'A4. '\", \"b'GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE AND PROGRAM BENEFICIARIES  '\", \"b'The Activity will build upon technical assistance provided by USAID/SA through previous and current '\", \"b'Activities. The geographic target area of the Activity includes the low burden provinces and districts listed '\", \"b'below:  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Free State - Mangaung and Fezile Dabi districts '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Limpopo - Vhembe and Sekhukhune districts '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Western Cape - West Coast and Cape Winelands districts '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Mpumalanga - Nkangala district '\", \"b'USAID/SA reserves the right to change geographic areas supported based on changes in the TB burden, '\", \"b'NDoH priorities and performance towards achieving the NDoH and END TB strategy targets. The '\", \"b'Recipient will tailor interventions as required to be able to reach specific target populations based on the '\", \"b'need, including but not limited to, public health managers at national and sub-national levels; adult '\", \"b'populations, infants, children, adolescents and youth under 25 years, pregnant and breastfeeding women, '\", \"b'men and specific age groups across sexes, addressing their unique needs, contexts and health seeking '\", \"b'behaviors. The Recipient will incorporate specific strategies to support populations that are hard to reach '\", \"b'by health services.  '\", \"b'A5. '\", \"b'GENDER CONSIDERATIONS '\", \"b'The USAID Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Policy advances equality between women '\", \"b'and men, boys, and girls, and empowers women and girls to participate fully in and benefit from '\", \"b'development activities, through the integration of gender in the entire project cycle from project design '\", \"b'and implementation to monitoring and evaluation.  '\", \"b'In South Africa, men have a TB prevalence almost 1.6 times higher than that of women because men '\", \"b'often prioritize work over seeking and engaging in healthcare, because of social norms related to '\", \"b'masculinity. Additionally, once on treatment, men are more likely to interrupt or stop care due to '\", \"b'isolation and limited access to social networks and have lower treatment success rates compared to '\", \"b'women.9 However, efforts to address this disparity in TB services have been limited. For instance, '\", \"b'TB messages have largely been excluded from the national MINA campaign, which aims to '\", \"b'9 The First National TB Prevalence Survey, South Africa, 2018 '\", \"b'20 '\", \"b'encourage men living with HIV to start and stay on treatment.  '\", \"b'Interventions supported through this Activity will implement a program model that addresses gender '\", \"b'inequities in TB service delivery in order to reduce gender disparities in the access of TB diagnosis, '\", \"b'treatment, and prevention services. The Activity will use evidence-based interventions informed by '\", \"b'gender analyses that explore the underlying reasons for gender-based differences throughout the entire '\", \"b'patient pathway. The Activity will integrate interventions throughout the program that promote early '\", \"b'care seeking behavior, and access to TB services equitably between men and women. Furthermore, '\", \"b'interventions will also uphold the right of all individuals - men, women, and transgender people to '\", \"b'quality TB services. '\", \"b'A6.

The applicant '\", \"b'must describe which cost elements it charges indirectly vs. directly.  See 2 CFR 200 for further '\", \"b'information. '\", \"b'If the applicant does not have an approved NICRA and does not elect to utilize the 10% de minimis rate, '\", \"b'the Agreement Officer will provide further instructions and may request additional supporting information, '\", \"b'including financial statements and audits, should the application still be under consideration after the merit '\", \"b'review.  USAID is under no obligation to approve the applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s requested method.  '\", \"b'Cost Sharing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 USAID has established a required cost share of ten percent (10%) of the Award\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s projected '\", \"b'value for the recipient of the award.

'\", \"b'This APS is intended to increase the sustainability and impact of USAID/Paraguay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s development '\", \"b'assistance through civil society, including grassroots organizations, and the private sector, as well '\", \"b'as related partnerships. Details are further elaborated in SECTION H: OTHER '\", \"b'INFORMATION. '\", \"b'A. Background   '\", \"b'USAID/Paraguay is committed to supporting Paraguayan leadership by prioritizing programs that '\", \"b'incentivize reforms, strengthen country capacity, and mobilize domestic resources.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExternal '\", \"b'development aid is more likely to catalyze sustained development processes when they reinforce '\", \"b'a country\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s internally determined development priorities (country ownership) and arrangements '\", \"b'(local systems)1.  This frames the need for Local Ownership.  Furthermore, for results to sustain, '\", \"b'one needs to engage the local system as a whole - government, civil society, including grassroots '\", \"b'organizations, and the private sector - focusing on local actors, their interrelationship, and the '\", \"b'incentives that guide them (Ibid., p. 4). Local ownership and local systems are the foundation for '\", \"b'sustainable development and hence, self-reliance. '\", \"b'To advance strategic transition and new models of bilateral engagement, spur innovation, and align '\", \"b'with the private sector\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s and civil society sector\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, including grassroots organization\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, interests '\", \"b'and opportunities, USAID/Paraguay has launched the Paraguay Local Works Initiative.  '\", \"b'Experience has shown that engaging the private and civil society sectors can be a force multiplier '\", \"b'for transformational change.  These sectors bring expertise, markets, assets, and innovation.   It is '\", \"b'not just about dollars, though; local actors can help solve critical development problems and '\", \"b'promote effective, sustainable development through market-led solutions or public pathways.  The '\", \"b'desired goal is that the Paraguay Local Works Initiative will create links between development '\", \"b'stakeholders that will continue once USAID funding ends. Recognizing and capitalizing on these '\", \"b'opportunities, the Paraguay Local Works Initiative will catalyze, facilitate, and support such '\", \"b'collaboration. '\", \"b'The Paraguay Local Works Initiative provides a non-traditional approach for achieving these '\", \"b'objectives. Within this context, USAID/Paraguay will prioritize private and civil society sector-'\", \"b'driven '\", \"b'solutions, '\", \"b'multi-stakeholder '\", \"b'partnerships '\", \"b'for '\", \"b'shared '\", \"b'value, '\", \"b'and '\", \"b'innovation.  '\", \"b'USAID/Paraguay encourages forging partnerships that promote collaboration with the private '\", \"b'sector and civil society in the joint definition of development challenges; identification of the most '\", \"b'promising, impactful solutions; and mutual contribution of resources.  Focus is placed on local '\", \"b'solutions that bring multiple stakeholders to the table to collaborate and systemically change how '\", \"b'assistance is transacted, and results are achieved to build a sustainable model that will hopefully '\", \"b'1 Source: https://www.usaid.gov/policy/local-systems-framework '\", \"b'4 '\", \"b'continue well into the future.  This multistakeholder, systemic and holistic approach should be '\", \"b'inclusive of vulnerable populations and capitalize on Paraguay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s demographic bond by garnering '\", \"b'the power of youth.  USAID defines innovations as those interventions that introduce novel '\", \"b'business or organizational models, operational or production processes; financing; or products or '\", \"b'services that lead to dramatic improvements (not incremental) in addressing development '\", \"b'challenges.  Innovation may incorporate science and technology, but this integration is not '\", \"b'required.  Innovation should help produce significant development outcomes more effectively and '\", \"b'sustainably to reach more beneficiaries in a shorter period.  As relevant, the Paraguay Local Works '\", \"b'Initiative may focus on identifying, testing, sharing, and scaling such game-changing '\", \"b'interventions. '\", \"b'B. An Invitation for Co-Design and Impact '\", \"b'The Paraguay Local Works Initiative is USAID/Paraguay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s invitation to local civil society and '\", \"b'private sector partners to work with USAID as an Implementing Partner to determine how our '\", \"b'respective interests and objectives align and jointly identify and define problems, challenges, and '\", \"b'opportunities that can most effectively be addressed by working together. The Paraguay Local '\", \"b'Works Initiative also provides a process through which USAID, local communities, grassroots '\", \"b'organizations  and other prospective partners can jointly examine and leverage expertise, '\", \"b'resources, and capabilities to scope, develop and implement effective solutions to the problems '\", \"b'and challenges identified. Mobilizing domestic public and private resources, especially from the '\", \"b'civil society and private sectors, is a priority of the Paraguay Local Works Initiative. These '\", \"b'partnerships help achieve core objectives in ways that could not be done alone. By engaging with '\", \"b'these sectors, USAID hopes to increase the reach, efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainable impact '\", \"b'of development investments and, as relevant, advance market-based solutions, as well as public '\", \"b'pathways for scale. '\", \"b'To foster sustainable and transformational development impact, the award process will entail '\", \"b'extensive partnering and collaboration between USAID/Paraguay and the Applicant from design '\", \"b'to implementation. Awards will be co-created. This means that USAID/Paraguay will work hand-'\", \"b'in-hand with applicants who have submitted promising concept papers to explore the best possible '\", \"b'strategy for addressing identified problems. To learn more about the co-creation process, please '\", \"b'visit '\", \"b'the '\", \"b'following '\", \"b'page:  '\", \"b'https://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/how-to-work-with-usaid/co-creation-usaid.  '\", \"b'C. Getting Started '\", \"b'What is the Paraguay Local Works Initiative? '\", \"b'Under Local Works, local actors can collectively identify their own development needs, agree on '\", \"b'a common agenda and form networks and alliances to achieve that agenda. More established local '\", \"b'organizations, with greater institutional capacity, will serve as mentors during this process. More '\", \"b'seasoned local civil society organization (CSO) partners will be Allies in Development, providing '\", \"b'5 '\", \"b'training and capacity building, as determined by beneficiaries, who will actually become key '\", \"b'stakeholders. USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s role will be that of a facilitator, catalyzer and convener, not a leader. '\", \"b'Treating beneficiaries as stakeholders is at the core of the Local Works approach.  '\", \"b'Local Works prioritizes Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) approaches, systems, and '\", \"b'tools that align with local communities\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 needs and what will be most useful for them, rather than '\", \"b'on the donor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s needs. Applicants should financially plan accordingly, including not only specific '\", \"b'MEL personnel, but also sufficient resources for systematic data collection, internal evaluations, '\", \"b'and regular learning exercises throughout the life of the program. Throughout the program, the '\", \"b'Mission will facilitate interventions based on feedback from local stakeholders.  '\", \"b'Under Local Works, USAID seeks to support local and non-traditional partners for innovative, '\", \"b'adaptive, and locally led development approaches in areas related to health, education, economic '\", \"b'opportunities, and community infrastructure. The prioritization of these areas is generally a result '\", \"b'of a listening tour commissioned by USAID in the first semester of 2021, in Paraguay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eight '\", \"b'poorest departments. The full report of the listening tour with areas prioritized by consulted '\", \"b'communities is available on USAID/Paraguay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s website. Illustrative examples of interventions '\", \"b'include: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Activities in the health sector that help families have access to low-cost but high quality '\", \"b'health services, supplies and medicines. Examples could include access to insurance, social '\", \"b'pharmacies, equipment and supplies for local health centers, attracting professional health '\", \"b'care workers to marginal communities, and ambulances. Preventive health, healthy '\", \"b'environment, including activities that respond to wildfires and droughts, and solid waste '\", \"b'disposal would also be considered.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Activities that improve economic opportunities for families such as support to value-chains '\", \"b'and identification of markets, technical training in trades and skills, particularly for youth, '\", \"b'leading to formal employment identified per employment market requirements, increased '\", \"b'access to financial information and training and technical assistance in business planning, '\", \"b'access to business loans and other low-cost financial help. Other activities could include '\", \"b'improving child care services allowing mothers to dedicate time for income producing '\", \"b'activities.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Activities in the education sector that: a) support improved virtual education such as access '\", \"b'to smartphones, computers or internet; b) help make technical and university level '\", \"b'education accessible economically as well as geographically; and c) support students '\", \"b'wishing to complete high school and post-high school studies.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f Activities that demonstrate support for improved small-scale infrastructure including, but '\", \"b'not limited to minor construction and maintenance of roads and bridges, access to '\", \"b'electricity, access to housing programs, housing refurbishment and access to clean water.

'\", \"b'2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements '\", \"b'Due to the nature of the collaboration implicit in the Paraguay Local Works Initiative '\", \"b'awards, USAID/Paraguay believes that Fixed Amount Awards (whereby USAID provides '\", \"b'a specific level of support for which the Agency does not base payment upon the actual '\", \"b'costs incurred by the recipient, but rather performance and results) and/or Cooperative '\", \"b'Agreements (in which substantial involvement will include approval of implementation '\", \"b'plans, key personnel, and Agency and Recipient collaboration or joint participation) will '\", \"b'14 '\", \"b'likely be the primary vehicle for this initiative.

'\", \"b' PROGRAM FUNDING AREA  '\", \"b'Problem Statement '\", \"b'In Paraguay, disadvantaged groups are excluded and deprived from access to quality public '\", \"b'services, including health, education, economic opportunities, and infrastructure.  '\", \"b'Background  '\", \"b'Paraguay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Country Roadmap helped visualize one of Paraguay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s greatest development hurdles: '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csocial group equality\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as it is one of the lowest in the region. Paraguay continues to be the fifth '\", \"b'most unequal country in Latin America. However, the foundations for development exist. There '\", \"b'are a number of advanced grassroots platforms, cooperatives perhaps being the best examples. '\", \"b'They are built around the principles of common good, mutual respect, self-determination, and have '\", \"b'been the drivers of Paraguay\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s recent economic development. In addition, there is a culture of '\", \"b'solidarity or \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cminga\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d, a traditional form of collaboration that helps communities work together to '\", \"b'solve problems, especially when the government is absent. Notably, women play a key role in '\", \"b'mingas, - and their voice is growing. Thanks to a culture of solidarity and association, Paraguayans '\", \"b'seem to have a unique ability to overcome difficulties, and they are ready to take on the '\", \"b'responsibility to design, fund and become accountable for their own development, rather than '\", \"b'limiting themselves to being mere beneficiaries of foreign assistance.  '\", \"b'Theory of Change  '\", \"b'If: Communities are enabled to self-identify their needs and priorities, and plan their own '\", \"b'development solutions, and they receive support from resource partners and more advanced '\", \"b'organizations, using a holistic systems approach, Then Communities will overcome their barriers '\", \"b'to development and thrive.  '\", \"b'Purpose Statement  '\", \"b'USAID will work with grassroots organizations, with a special focus on women and youth, and '\", \"b'other vulnerable populations, to help them self-identify their needs and lead their own development '\", \"b'17 '\", \"b'solutions, fostering ownership and empowerment, and building accountability and resiliency '\", \"b'within the community and at the national level.

With USAID '\", \"b' support, Rwanda is turning the corner in reversing chronic high illiteracy rates among primary  school '\", \"b' students. In fact, according to the Learning Achievement in Rwandan Schools (LARS) 2021 assessment, '\", \"b' 68% of P3 students are performing at or above grade-level standards on Kinyarwanda reading '\", \"b' comprehension and 54% on oral reading fluency  .

'\", \"b' However, while primary education access in Rwanda is high, with net enrolment standing at over 98 '\", \"b' percent for both boys and girls, many pupils still do not acquire sufficient foundational skills.   The World '\", \"b' Bank (WB)\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s recently developed human capital index, consisting largely of education and health-related '\", \"b' indicators, places Rwanda at 142 out of 157 countries assessed, on a par with its impoverished and '\", \"b' conflict-affected neighbors Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Access to and quality of '\", \"b' pre-primary education are low, and many children enter primary school unprepared to learn.  Children and '\", \"b' youth with disabilities face many barriers accessing basic education, including stigma, poor infrastructure '\", \"b' and limited resources, and teachers who are inadequately trained to meet their needs. Since literacy is the '\", \"b' 1  The term deaf is meant to be an umbrella term including people who may identify as deaf, deafblind (a person who is deaf and '\", \"b' blind), deaf disabled (a person who is deaf and has an additional disability such as Autism, intellectual disability, wheelchair user, '\", \"b' etc.), hard of hearing, late-deafened, and other terms used in the local context. The intent is to recognize the shared experiences '\", \"b' within the deaf community while also honoring differences.

The lack of learning in school, beginning in the '\", \"b' early grades, is a huge constraint to Rwanda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ambition to become a middle-income country with a '\", \"b' knowledge-based economy.  '\", \"b' A.2.2 EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT FOR DEAF LEARNERS IN RWANDA '\", \"b' Ableism and linguisticism are often status quo.  These discriminatory framings have profound implications '\", \"b' on all aspects of life with respect to human diversity especially for persons with disabilities and minority '\", \"b' language users.  As members of both the disability and language minority communities, deaf communities '\", \"b' face a unique challenge.  Deaf children and youth persistently face communication and learning barriers '\", \"b' concurrently.  Parents of these children are often ashamed, unaware, misinformed, and ill-equipped to '\", \"b' develop the necessary sign language skills.  This leads to limited meaningful communication with their '\", \"b' children.  Furthermore, these parents often unintentionally hinder the development of their children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b' foundational skills, including language and pre-literacy.  This gap in early child development usually leads '\", \"b' to language deprivation and can include delays to cognitive, language, and social-emotional development  . '\", \"b'3'\", \"b' With weak foundations, future opportunities are adversely impacted and often difficult to mitigate  . '\", \"b'4'\", \"b' Deaf children have historically faced many barriers to equitable and quality education, including the lack '\", \"b' of instruction in sign language, which constitutes a denial of their human rights (WFD, 2016).  Article '\", \"b' 24(3)(c) of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), ratified by the Government '\", \"b' of Rwanda, requires deaf children to be educated in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe most appropriate languages and modes and means '\", \"b' of communication for the individual, and in environments which maximize their academic and social '\", \"b' development.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d (CRPD, 2006). '\", \"b' Rwanda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legal, policy, and institutional framework also recognizes the importance of protecting and '\", \"b' promoting the rights of persons with disabilities. In 2019, the GOR approved MINEDUC\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s SNIE Policy, '\", \"b' which constituted a major step forward in ensuring quality education for the most vulnerable children.  The '\", \"b' policy is currently in the early phases of implementation.  As a result, the basic education system is still not '\", \"b' adequately supporting learning for the most vulnerable.  According to 2018 MINEDUC statistics, 0.7% of '\", \"b' students in primary schools and 0.5% of students in nursery schools have a known disability, while a recent '\", \"b' assessment found that approximately 38% of students faced functional difficulties (a proxy measure for '\", \"b' disability).  '\", \"b' This data suggests a significant gap in understanding and support for children with disabilities.   Moreover, '\", \"b' the sector has insufficient data on aggregated and disaggregated learning and prevalence rates for children '\", \"b' with disabilities. The sector also has limited referral and rehabilitation services. Teachers are also not fully '\", \"b' equipped with the skills or resources to support specialized learning at each child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s respective level.  The '\", \"b' Rwandan Statistical Yearbook 2019 indicates that 12% of primary school pupils with disabilities are either '\", \"b' deaf or deaf and blind (1,423 deaf; 558 deaf and blind (p. 33)). That notwithstanding, the MINEDUC\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b' SNIE Policy recognizes the unique challenges faced by learners with hearing challenges.  The policy states '\", \"b' they \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9care particularly challenged because Sign language as a Language of instruction for schools is neither '\", \"b' fully recognized by the Ministry of Education nor integrated in teacher training programs.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d '\", \"b' 3  Less than 2% of the 34 million deaf children worldwide gain access to a signed language in early childhood and therefore deaf '\", \"b' children overwhelmingly experience delays in their cognitive and language development throughout those critical development '\", \"b' years (Murray, Hal, & Snoddon, 2019, p. 712; ACR, 2021). '\", \"b' 4  Build a better future for deaf schoolchildren or risk losing a generation of potential | Blog | Global Partnership for Education '\", \"b' 5 '\", \"b' A.2.3 RWANDAN SIGN LANGUAGE '\", \"b' According to global research, deaf children and deaf youth from families fluent in a sign language attain '\", \"b' language and learning milestones on par with their hearing peers. Sign language enables deaf children to '\", \"b' acquire the cognitive foundations for all language; without introduction to a fully-developed sign language, '\", \"b' these children are limited to a small range of vocabulary that may have been created only within a small '\", \"b' social circle, cutting them off from wider social relations and from further learning. With sign language, '\", \"b' deaf children acquire full language foundations that allow them to then learn a second (written) language '\", \"b' and communicate with others through both sign and written text. Unfortunately, these examples are far too '\", \"b' few in Rwanda due to stigma and lack of opportunities to learn RSL.  As a result of these barriers, if they '\", \"b' start school, it is usually years behind their hearing peers with many attending primary school  as '\", \"b'5'\", \"b' teenagers.  This population, especially deaf girls  , remain among the most marginalized because they may '\", \"b'6'\", \"b' also experience neglect and sexual abuse.  Persons who are deaf can embody the nexus of gender, '\", \"b' disability, socio-economic status, geographic location, religion, language, and other identities in society. '\", \"b' Additionally, this Activity will support commitments from the UNESCO Salamanca Statement and '\", \"b' Framework for Action on Special Needs Education (1994)  , where it proposed a policy shift recognizing '\", \"b'7'\", \"b' that sign language access for deaf learners is essential to upholding the right to education for all.  In 2006, '\", \"b' the UN\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s CRPD obliged governments to secure the human right to a signed language in legislation, and '\", \"b' mandated and clarified that deaf children should be provided with the opportunity to learn sign language '\", \"b' (Article 24 and General Comment 4).  Lastly, UNICEF\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b' Guidance Document on Sign Language and Deaf Children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Education stated children who are deaf and '\", \"b' are deprived of sign language should acquire it through primary class 3 to develop literacy skills  .   In '\", \"b'8'\", \"b' essence, this Activity will embrace evidence that rejects a debilitating medical perspective viewing '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98deafness/hearing loss\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 as a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cproblem\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d to be \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfixed\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d.  Instead, it will adopt a social-cultural perspective '\", \"b' that recognizes RSL as the primary conduit and modality for instruction and communication for Rwandan '\", \"b' deaf language learners. '\", \"b' RSL is the language Rwandan deaf children and youth can most easily and readily use and understand; and '\", \"b' therefore, it should be considered their first language.  For that reason, to support these children and youth, '\", \"b' the teaching and learning of RSL must begin at home, in communities, in early childhood centers, and in '\", \"b' primary schools.  Pre-service and in-service teachers of children and youth who are deaf (or similar '\", \"b' teachers receiving Inclusive Education and/or Universal Design for Learning (UDL) training) should '\", \"b' become proficient in RSL and use this as the language of instruction.  Otherwise, their teaching would, by '\", \"b' unintentional design, universally and categorically exclude children and youth who are deaf. '\", \"b' 5  USAID programs also are likely to engage individuals  aged 10-29 as a broader youth cohort. '\", \"b' https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1870/Youth_in_Development_Policy_0.pdf  (page 4) '\", \"b' 6  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDeaf women (and girls) are twice as likely to experience domestic '\", \"b' abuse. https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/10/how-deaf-women-are-vulnerable-domestic-abuse-tragic-story '\", \"b' -safiya '\", \"b' 7  https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000098427 '\", \"b' 8  It is therefore the recommendation that instructional policies for deaf learners who enter school without prior access '\", \"b' to sign language concentrate on supporting national sign language acquisition at least in the early years of schooling, '\", \"b' i.e., through grade 3, before introducing instruction in other languages. Furthermore, teaching and learning in the '\", \"b' national sign language should continue throughout primary and secondary school years for full comprehension. Sign '\", \"b' language proficiency plays a role in learning to read, as reading is a sound-based Activity, where letters and words '\", \"b' have to be decoded. A different approach to teaching literacy is required for deaf learners, and this includes using '\", \"b' sign language to give meaning to words. (Sign) language skills must be developed before literacy skills can be added. '\", \"b' (p. 11) '\", \"b' 6 '\", \"b' USAID (through its Soma Umenye (SU) and Tunoze Gusoma (TG) activities) and the Rwandan National '\", \"b' Union of the Deaf (RNUD) completed the second edition of the RSL Dictionary (with its agreed upon '\", \"b' variations  ).  It was then recently approved by the GOR\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s National Council for Persons with Disabilities '\", \"b'9'\", \"b' (NCPD).  This second edition expands the first edition\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s 800 signs to over 2,000 signs with improved and '\", \"b' easier to understand illustrations and descriptions, which presents an opportunity for further investment to '\", \"b' ensure its sustainability of use in education. '\", \"b' Currently, NCPD is working with the Minister of State of the Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) '\", \"b' and Social Affairs to get the Prime Minister of Rwanda to support codifying the RSL Dictionary.  Once '\", \"b' that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s done, the approved dictionary will facilitate Parliament\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s consideration of RSL as another official '\", \"b' language of Rwanda. '\", \"b' A.2.4 RELATIONSHIP TO USAID-FUNDED ACTIVITIES '\", \"b' USAID/Rwanda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) 2020-2025 goal:  Rwanda has the '\", \"b' strengthened human capital, robust private sector, and accountable institutions required to advance '\", \"b' self-reliance.  Development Objective 2 (DO2) of the  CDCS is to improve learning outcomes .  Therefore, '\", \"b' in coordination with development partners and the Government of Rwanda (GOR), USAID improves '\", \"b' foundational skills with a specific focus on literacy in the early grades of education to improve human '\", \"b' capital in Rwanda. USAID works in all of the country\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s public and government-aided primary schools to '\", \"b' improve the quality of early grade literacy instruction by building the capacity of teachers and working '\", \"b' with the government and the private sector to equip classrooms with textbooks and other learning '\", \"b' materials. USAID also addresses education management systems, working in partnership with the '\", \"b' MINEDUC, NESA, and the Rwanda Education Board (REB) to strengthen the education system and '\", \"b' involve parents and community members more directly in education governance in communities and '\", \"b' districts. '\", \"b' This Activity will leverage TG\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s investments in the final stages of production of the RSL Dictionary.  For '\", \"b' background, although SU ceremonially handed the RSL Dictionary over to NCPD in early 2022, at that '\", \"b' time, SU was unable to complete all final Dictionary edits and reviews before its contract ended. '\", \"b' Therefore, TG committed to completing the Dictionary production process. Now, while this Dictionary '\", \"b' will help to standardize RSL for the first time, a dictionary is merely a resource tool for teaching and '\", \"b' learning. The Dictionary must be accompanied by an actual RSL training program that will enable teachers '\", \"b' and students to use the Dictionary to help build their fluency in RSL. The absence of such a training course '\", \"b' would compromise the sustainable and effective use of the RSL Dictionary. Therefore, this Activity will '\", \"b' need to identify how best to incorporate the effective use of the RSL Dictionary into its interventions. '\", \"b' The Uburezi Iwacu (UI) Activity works to improve the mindset families and community members have '\", \"b' about children with disabilities. Specifically, UI works to reduce the stigmatization of persons with '\", \"b' disabilities and promote access to equitable and inclusive education. UI also works with parents and '\", \"b' guardians approaches to identify and address the needs of their children. This Activity will complement UI '\", \"b' by specifically equipping families and community members of deaf students with needed RSL skills to '\", \"b' communicate. '\", 'b\" 9  Per the  World Federation of the Deaf\\'s Statement on Sign Language Standardization  , a  sign language dictionary \"', \"b' work should always document all the different signs and their variations that deaf people in a community or area use. '\", \"b' It is not advisable to pick only one sign for one word when documenting sign languages. '\", \"b' 7 '\", \"b' The Activity will also synergize with the following complementing USAID activities: '\", \"b' 1.  The  Teaching and Learning Materials Market Systems  Development Activity  intends to work with '\", \"b' both the public and private sectors to increase the production, publication, affordability, and '\", \"b' availability of Rwandan-made books, including digital RSL storybooks. '\", \"b' 2.  The  Orphans and Vulnerable Children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (OVC) Fund  is  working with families and communities to '\", \"b' increase early childhood development outcomes. As a result, this fund presents an opportunity to lay '\", \"b' some of the groundwork for this Activity by raising the importance of early childhood education, '\", \"b' especially for deaf children who typically experience delayed language acquisition and other cognitive '\", \"b' development. '\", \"b' 3.  The  Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA Adaptation)  Activity  will: (1) develop EGRA tools '\", \"b' for P1 to P3 learners who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision, and have intellectual '\", \"b' disabilities; 2) build the capacity of workshop participants from MINEDUC, NESA, REB, and relevant '\", \"b' civil-society organizations (CSOs) to conduct similar adaptations in the future for other assessment '\", \"b' instruments used in Rwanda, such as the Learning Achievement in Rwandan  Schools (LARS) and '\", \"b' Local Early Grade Reading Assessment (LEGRA). '\", \"b' 4.  The  Deaf Education Language of Instruction Transitions  in Education Systems (DELITES) '\", \"b' Research Study Activity  will: (1) advance USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  global learning agenda in education about '\", \"b' transition to language of instruction ecosystems; and (2) explore how different language of instruction '\", \"b' policy approaches, system factors, and local-level conditions & practices explain variations in reading '\", \"b' outcomes among deaf learners in primary grades in Rwanda; and (3) provide evidence-informed '\", \"b' guidance on language of instruction transition policy design and practice in Rwanda. '\", \"b' USAID has supported similar projects in  Jamaica ,  Nigeria  ,  Morocco ,  the Philippines , and  Kenya  . The new '\", \"b' Activity will build on evidence and learning from these activities. '\", \"b' A.3 '\", \"b' RESULTS '\", \"b' The purpose of the SPLD Activity is to help Rwandan learners who are deaf achieve commensurate, early '\", \"b' grade-level reading skills. '\", \"b' USAID/Rwanda posits that: '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  If  parents and community members of deaf children  can learn a minimum proficiency level of RSL and '\", \"b' can support the learning of literacy skills for their deaf children; and '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  if  teachers  and teacher trainers can achieve an assessed RSL fluency level and learn quality, bilingual '\", \"b'10'\", \"b' deaf education pedagogy to teach literacy skills; and '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  if  deaf youth and adults (and/or hearing Rwandans)  can support RSL learning and literacy skills in '\", \"b' classrooms, schools, homes, and communities, '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  then  more deaf children can learn RSL and learn  to read with comprehension in Kinyarwanda. '\", \"b' 10  Teachers here refers to three types of primary school teachers: i) those student teachers going through pre-service training; ii) '\", \"b' those teachers working in mainstream or integrated classrooms with at least one deaf student; and iii) those teachers working in '\", \"b' specialized schools. '\", \"b' 8 '\", \"b' The results framework below summarizes the intermediate results (IR) to be achieved by this Activity: '\", \"b' CDCS Development Objective 2: Improved Learning Outcomes '\", \"b' LEARN Project Purpose: Improved literacy outcomes for all Rwandan children by the end of P3.

By focusing on children and youth '\", \"b' who are deaf, this Activity supports children with disabilities by intentionally addressing a critical equity '\", \"b' gap deaf learners face in traditional primary school education systems.  By ensuring children and youth '\", \"b' who are deaf are taught in a language they understand and are supported by community members who can '\", \"b' communicate with them, this Activity will contribute to the CDCS\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s intermediate results 2.1 (Improved '\", \"b' inclusive and quality early grade literacy classroom instruction) and 2.3 (Strengthened community support '\", \"b' for learning). This Activity was included in the LEARN Project\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Project Design Document. '\", \"b' The Activity will demonstrate the value of a data-driven and evidence-based bilingual deaf education '\", \"b' approach in Rwanda.  These approaches will help build deaf children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s foundational skills and ensure '\", \"b' effective teaching strategies that will result in improved learning outcomes for deaf students  .  Furthermore, '\", \"b' promoting deaf youth to become teachers and/or teaching assistants and creating opportunities for '\", \"b' Rwandans to gain RSL proficiency are potential ways to develop a pipeline of Rwandans that can teach '\", \"b' 9 '\", \"b' using RSL as the language of instruction.  The Activity will also create equitable and inclusive '\", \"b' opportunities for deaf people to enter higher education and become teachers. '\", \"b' To achieve this purpose, this Activity will focus its efforts on three main results: '\", \"b' Result 1: Improved parental and community member support for deaf learners '\", \"b' This result aims to give deaf children and their family members the opportunity to learn RSL as early as '\", \"b' hearing children learn spoken languages.  While this Activity is not a medical intervention, social and '\", \"b' behavioral change communication approaches and connections with public health agencies would be '\", \"b' instrumental to detect and refer deaf children to the appropriate service providers.  Meanwhile, parents and '\", \"b' family members of deaf children will be given the chance to acquire RSL themselves.  Additionally, the '\", \"b' deaf child will also be able to learn and use RSL at home and within their communities so that s/he is able '\", \"b' to effectively communicate with family and community members as early as possible.  Ultimately, this '\", \"b' result will help to reduce the social stigma and behaviors that create barriers to learning for deaf learners. '\", \"b' Result 2: Strengthened teacher pedagogy and RSL fluency '\", \"b' To ensure deaf primary school learners can read well in Kinyarwanda, a key competence  will be the '\", \"b' teacher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ability to teach the deaf learners in a language they most easily understand - RSL.  Therefore, the '\", \"b' first purpose of this result is to ensure teachers going through pre-service training, teachers working in '\", \"b' mainstream or integrated classrooms with at least one deaf student, and teachers working in deaf and/or '\", \"b' specialized schools can learn RSL, be assessed in RSL, and achieve an RSL fluency level sufficient to '\", \"b' conduct lessons that deaf learners can actively follow, participate in, and understand.  The second purpose '\", \"b' of this result is to ensure the teachers acquire the bilingual deaf education pedagogical skills, '\", \"b' accompanying teaching and learning materials, and needed coaching and support system to effectively '\", \"b' teach lessons in RSL. '\", \"b' Result 3: Increased youth engagement to support RSL learning and deaf learners '\", \"b' This result aims to capitalize on the already developed RSL skills and talent of deaf Rwandan youth to '\", \"b' improve early grade reading skills of deaf primary students.  It will teach youth skills to be RSL trainers '\", \"b' and advocates, mentors to hearing and deaf parents of deaf children, teaching assistants, and possibly even '\", \"b' teachers as well.  This key segment of the deaf community has the potential to sustainably change the '\", \"b' plight of deaf Rwandans.  Through this result, these youth will not only be able to help deaf children gain '\", \"b' fundamental language, communication, and cognitive skills, but they will also be able to develop their own '\", \"b' career potential by contributing to the broader bilingual deaf education system as RSL trainers, teaching '\", \"b' assistants, teachers, and possibly private sector as well.  This Activity will pioneer explicit recognition and '\", \"b' use of RSL as a language of instruction and modality of communication in academic and social settings for '\", \"b' deaf children, youth, and adults. '\", \"b' 10 '\", \"b' A.4 '\", \"b' PARAMETERS '\", \"b' The parameters detailed in this section are meant to provide boundaries and focus for the implementation '\", \"b' of the SPLD Activity. '\", \"b' A.4.1 TARGET BENEFICIARIES '\", \"b' The primary target end beneficiaries of this Activity are deaf children whose age or academic ability '\", \"b' correspond with pre-primary and lower primary school grade levels in Rwanda. Generally, this will include '\", \"b' children ages 4-9, but the Activity may include younger and older children who stand to benefit from '\", \"b' interventions targeted at those grade levels.  The  SPLD Activity will target all deaf children in this age '\", \"b'11'\", \"b' range, regardless of whether they are in or out of school.  The age range of children with disabilities, '\", \"b' whether or not they are in schools, may differ from children without disabilities (especially those who are '\", \"b' deaf) because of challenges they face in Rwandan society.  Other beneficiaries are parents/caregivers, other '\", \"b' family members, local leaders at the village, cell, sector, and district levels, youth and other community '\", \"b' volunteers engaged in social services delivery, school leaders and local education officials related to or '\", \"b' familiar with deaf children in their homes, communities, classrooms, and schools. '\", \"b' A.4.2 GEOGRAPHICAL FOCUS '\", \"b' The Activity will affect the deaf population throughout the country, but its district-level implementation '\", \"b' will depend on the location of the deaf learners and their family members.  Regarding teaching training, '\", \"b' the geographical focus will most likely reflect areas in the country where there are existing schools that '\", \"b' serve children/youth who are deaf.  Specifically, the Activity will focus on REB\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Teacher Training '\", \"b' Colleges, the 18 schools where most of the student population consists of students who are deaf, and, if '\", \"b' feasible, the University of Rwanda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s College of Education and potentially other schools and institutions '\", \"b' too. '\", \"b' A.4.3 TARGETED SKILLS '\", \"b' The primary Activity outcomes will focus on the acquisition and use of RSL among deaf children, deaf '\", \"b' youth, their family members, their community members, and their teachers to improve reading '\", \"b' performance for deaf Rwandan learners.  The Activity will work to improve the capacity of teacher '\", \"b' education institutions to produce quality bilingual teachers who can deliver quality deaf education services '\", \"b' to learners in the early grades.  By strengthening these foundational skills and systems, the Activity will '\", \"b' help create more pathways to learning and higher education for Rwandan children and youth who are deaf. '\", \"b' A.5 '\", \"b' GUIDING PRINCIPLES '\", \"b' This section provides details on guiding principles that apply to all interventions in the SPLD Activity. '\", \"b' A.5.1 UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING '\", \"b' The purpose of this Activity is to improve the quality of instruction for children and youth who are deaf in '\", \"b' Rwanda. For an education system to become inclusive of learners who are deaf, it must have the capacity '\", \"b' 11  The target age range is meant to guide implementation.  Due to various reasons, however, including but not limited to grade '\", \"b' repetition and the late enrollment of children with disabilities, USAID expects that there will be children of slightly varying ages '\", \"b' reached by the Activity. '\", \"b' 11 '\", \"b' to integrate principles of  Universal Design for Learning  (UDL) to address gaps in achieving access to '\", \"b'12'\", \"b' quality education for children and youth who are deaf. UDL looks at providing multiple means of engaging '\", \"b' learners, multiple means of representing learning content and of action and expression. UDL principles '\", \"b' should be reflected throughout all aspects of this Activity.  Also, the Activity should use existing curricula, '\", \"b' materials, and content while staying true to evidence-based approaches of bilingual deaf education good '\", \"b' practices and respecting the deaf and Rwandan contexts to improve access to a quality, inclusive education. '\", \"b' A.5.2 BEHAVIOR CHANGE '\", \"b' A behavior change approach to this Activity will help stem the pervasive social stigma and discrimination '\", \"b' that plagues deaf children in Rwanda.  The SPLD Activity will build the capacity, knowledge, and skills of '\", \"b' parents, caregivers, community members, teachers, alongside relevant GOR actors to support learning for '\", \"b' deaf children and youth in Rwanda. Results will require significant attitudinal and behavioral shifts among '\", \"b' stakeholders and beneficiaries.  Thus, the SPLD Activity will utilize a behavior change approach to '\", \"b' achieve sustainable results, incorporating the evidence base and implementation science on what has been '\", \"b' effective in making behavior change in homes, communities, classrooms, and schools. '\", \"b' A.5.3 SUSTAINABILITY '\", \"b' While this is only a four-year activity, it intends to build MINEDUC, REB, NESA, and possibly the '\", \"b' URCE\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S capacity to deliver a quality bilingual deaf education program in Rwanda.  Training and assessing '\", \"b' educators\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fluency in RSL, providing deaf Rwandans with opportunities to support Rwanda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s education '\", \"b' system, and changing the behaviors of family members of deaf learners are all key to sustaining this '\", \"b' Activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s outcomes. '\", \"b' A.5.4 PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOR, DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS, AND OTHER '\", \"b' STAKEHOLDERS '\", \"b' In addition to linkages to various USAID activities above, externally, the Activity will directly '\", \"b' complement  the World Bank\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (WB) Inclusive Education  Initiative (IEI) investments.  In collaboration '\", \"b' with the University of Rwanda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s College of Education (URCE) Special Needs and Inclusive Education '\", \"b' Unit, t he WB/IEI developed a continuous professional  development (CPD), teacher training curriculum '\", \"b' that focuses on Braille education, RSL, deaf culture, and approaches to deaf education.  Specifically, '\", \"b' URCE and t he WB are creating a modular-based teacher  CPD program that includes 400 hours of RSL and '\", \"b' Braille training.  However, the content and quality of this course will undergo stakeholder validation very '\", \"b' soon.  In the meantime, the funding for implementing these modules is vulnerable, as in-service teachers '\", \"b' are currently expected to self-finance this optional professional development training. '\", \"b' In addition to the newly-formed National Steering Committee on Foundational Learning, MINEDUC\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b' Sector Working Group has six technical working groups (TWG) supporting the sector.  They are: a) '\", \"b' Information, Communication, Technical Education; b) Center for Professional Development; c) SNIE; d) '\", \"b' School Feeding; e) Rwanda Reads; and f) Curriculum, Materials, and Assessment.  With USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s support, '\", \"b' the SNIE TWG conducted a coordination survey exercise to help the REB SNIE TWG Chair better '\", \"b' understand what interventions TWG members are doing and in what districts. The SNIE TWG comprises '\", \"b' bilateral and multilateral organizations as well as international and Rwandan NGOs, faith-based '\", \"b' organizations, private sector companies, and Organizations of Persons with Disabilities (DPOs).   '\", \"b' 12  UDL: The UDL Guidelines (cast.org) '\", \"b' 12 '\", \"b' Findings from that data collection showed the majority of TWG members are conducting a range of SNIE '\", \"b' activities categorized as inclusive education \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cin-general.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Activities include teacher training, attitudinal '\", \"b' advocacy, teaching and learning materials provision, assistive technology support, teacher coaching, and '\", \"b' more.  However, another crucial finding was the critical gap in the number and reach of interventions '\", \"b' addressing barriers faced by children and youth who are deaf.  Consequently, a conclusion that was '\", \"b' reached was: if inclusive education interventions by TWG members are not specifically bridging the '\", \"b' specific language and learning needs that children who are deaf face, then how inclusive are these '\", \"b' interventions?  Therefore, this Activity would not overlap with the efforts of partner governments, '\", \"b' development partners (DPs), and other organizations.  Rather this Activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s objectives will not only '\", \"b' complement, but will also strengthen, the GOR and MINEDUC\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s SNIE TWG\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s efforts to provide a truly '\", \"b' inclusive education for all learners.  '\", \"b' Additionally, the GOR, Rwandan DPOs, including RNUD, and key development partners in Rwanda have '\", \"b' been supportive of working in disability-inclusive education and of the progress with the RSL Dictionary. '\", \"b' And while attitudes, stigma, and limited resources remain challenges, the stakeholders in this particular '\", \"b' Rwandan landscape are keenly aware of them and are working together to improve them as well. '\", \"b' Therefore, effective partnership with the key development partners, Rwandan DPOs, and the GOR is '\", \"b' critical to the success of this Activity. The SPLD Activity will collaborate with MINEDUC, REB, NESA, '\", \"b' MINALOC, and the Local Administrative Entities Development Agency, the Ministry of Gender and '\", \"b' Family Promotion, the National Child Development Authority, and the NCPD. Village, cell, sector, and '\", \"b' district leaders\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 support and leadership are also crucial for the Activity to achieve meaningful results. '\", \"b' A.5.5 LOCALLY-LED DEVELOPMENT VIA RWANDAN DPOS AND OTHER '\", \"b' RELEVANT CSOS '\", \"b' In support of the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing about us without us\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d principle, DPOs must be part of the design, '\", \"b' implementation, and evaluation of this Activity.  DPOs are defined as organizations where people with '\", \"b' disabilities provide leadership and constitute the majority of the staff, board, and volunteers. DPOs can '\", \"b' include parent organizations representing children or individuals with disabilities where the primary aim of '\", \"b' the organization is the empowerment and growth of self-advocacy of people with disabilities. DPOs are '\", \"b' organizations of, by, and for people with disabilities. Partnering with DPOs ensures both a participatory '\", \"b' approach and that lived disability experiences are included in USAID activities. This activity must '\", \"b' leverage knowledge and expertise within DPOs and ensure that people with disabilities are involved '\", \"b' throughout activity planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Furthermore, exposing key '\", \"b' stakeholders to DPOs builds understanding about disability. '\", \"b' Additionally, this Activity must endeavor to collaborate with Rwandan DPOs as well as other Rwandan '\", \"b' CSOs that work to remove barriers for children and youth who are deaf.  This Activity should also consult '\", \"b' with other Rwandan DPOs that advocate for Rwandan learners with other, non-hearing-related disabilities. '\", \"b' Engaging with these groups will make this Activity more sustainable and complement efforts to ensure no '\", \"b' child or youth with disabilities is left behind. '\", \"b' A.5.6 PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT '\", \"b' The Activity will engage the private sector to facilitate access to reading, teaching, and learning materials '\", \"b' needed to achieve the Activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s objective.  The engagement will consider how to leverage the private '\", \"b' 13 '\", \"b' sector to increase the availability of accessible materials deaf Rwandan primary school students, their '\", \"b' families, and their community members too. '\", \"b' A.5.7 COVID-19 ADAPTATIONS '\", \"b' While the COVID-19 situation is unpredictable, the last year has proven that USAID and the GOR\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ability '\", \"b' to adapt and identify creative approaches to continue implementation and impact may be potentially '\", \"b' mitigated using education technology.  The Activity should be designed to be responsive to how children '\", \"b' have already been affected by COVID-19, including the extended period of school closure in Rwanda that '\", \"b' may have led to learning loss, and should address potential ongoing challenges related to the COVID-19 '\", \"b' pandemic and implications for the delivery of services and achievement of results under this Activity  . '\", \"b'13'\", \"b' A.5.8 GENDER EQUALITY AND SOCIAL INCLUSION '\", \"b' In Rwanda, gender differences have been noted in children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s participation in learning activities, where girls '\", \"b' sometimes participate more than boys. The SPLD Activity will endeavor to ensure that all deaf children '\", \"b' benefit from and participate equally in reading interventions. The Activity will continue to support girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 '\", \"b' active participation, while including a greater focus on removing all barriers that prevent boys from '\", \"b' benefiting from learning interventions. '\", \"b' Gender differences have also been noted in caregivers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 participation in school activities and support for '\", \"b' children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s development and learning outside of school. Male caregivers participate in communicating with '\", \"b' teachers and school staff more than mothers, among other areas,  while female caregivers play a more '\", \"b'14'\", \"b' engaged role in children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s language and literacy development outside of school. Evidence indicates that '\", \"b' increased engagement of fathers in child-related activities has significant beneficial effects on children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b' cognitive, linguistic, and socioemotional development.  The SPLD Activity will address these gender '\", \"b'15'\", \"b' differences and support both female and male caregivers in children\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lives, be they mother, father, '\", \"b' grandparent, aunt, uncle, or community member. '\", \"b' The Activity will endeavor to ensure that all deaf children benefit and participate equally in reading '\", \"b' interventions. While girls and women will be encouraged to sustain their active participation, a greater '\", \"b' focus will also be made to remove all barriers that prevent male students and parents/caregivers from '\", \"b' increasing their participation. '\", \"b' The Activity will follow the agency\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guidelines for gender equality and social inclusion and should use '\", \"b' the  guidance on how to integrate disability into gender  analyses . '\", \"b' As required by USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  Gender Equality and Women\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  Empowerment Policy ,  ADS Chapter 205 , and the '\", 'b\" Women\\'s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment (WEEE) Act of 2018  , a gender analysis must \"', \"b' inform the Activity design and implementation.  Per the WEEE Act, the gender analysis \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cmeans a '\", \"b' socioeconomic analysis of available or gathered quantitative and qualitative information to identify, '\", \"b' understand, and explain gaps between men and women which typically involves examining:  differences in '\", \"b' 13  See the following for some initial findings on the impact of school closures in Rwanda: '\", \"b' https://www.educationdevelopmenttrust.com/our-research-and-insights/research/school-closures-in-the-context-of-covid-19-an-ine '\", \"b' q '\", \"b' 14  Save the Children.

'\", \"b' 14 '\", \"b' the status of women and men and their differential access to and control over assets, resources, education, '\", \"b' opportunities, and services; the influence of gender roles, structural barriers, and norms on the division of '\", \"b' time between paid employment, unpaid work (including the subsistence production and care for family '\", \"b' members), and volunteer activities; the influence of gender roles, structural  barriers, and norms on '\", \"b' leadership roles and decision making; constraints, opportunities, and entry points for narrowing gender '\", \"b' gaps and empowering women; and potential differential impacts of development policies and programs on '\", \"b' men and women, including unintended or negative consequences; and includes conclusions and '\", \"b' recommendations to development policies and programs to narrow gender gaps and improve the lives of '\", \"b' women and girls. ADS 205 provides guidance on how to plan, implement, and follow up on a gender '\", \"b' analysis.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d '\", \"b' To achieve gender parity, the Activity will be required to conduct a Gender Equality and Social Inclusion '\", \"b' (GESI) analysis related to deaf learners within the first months of implementation and use the findings to '\", \"b' identify strategic interventions to increase female empowerment and gender equality, and to encourage the '\", \"b' equal participation of men and women, girls, and boys in interventions. Given this Activity\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s focus on '\", \"b' benefiting all children, including children with disabilities, the GESI analysis must also address the '\", \"b' intersection of gender and disability for both children and parents. The findings will be incorporated into '\", \"b' Annual Work and Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) plans throughout the implementation. '\", \"b' A.5.9 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICT) '\", \"b' The SPLD Activity will strategically leverage ICT to increase the reach, efficiency, and effectiveness of '\", \"b' interventions. Incorporation of ICT will facilitate use of all users, including women and people with '\", \"b' disabilities, to promote equal access to information and reading materials. From RSL laboratories (where '\", \"b' teachers of children who are deaf could visit to improve their RSL proficiency) to the creation of digital '\", \"b' platforms that will bring more stories to life for children who are deaf via stories told in RSL and '\", \"b' Kinyarwanda  .  This aspect of the Activity will leverage  technology to make learning more possible for '\", \"b'16'\", \"b' children who are deaf.  Digital applications that can be created and installed on tablets and shared in '\", \"b' communal settings ranging from homes, community libraries to classrooms will enable efficient RSL '\", \"b' penetration and its dictionary.   This app will support RSL acquisition in classroom settings, particularly '\", \"b' early childhood programs. '\", \"b' All ICT interventions will also fully integrate the aforementioned UDL principles to ensure accessibility '\", \"b' for all  . ICT interventions will take care not to  replace nor infringe on the primacy of the serve-and-return, '\", \"b'17'\", \"b' adult-child interactions that are associated with long term gains in learning and skills. '\", \"b'18'\", \"b' A.5.10 DO NO HARM '\", \"b' The Activity will recognize that harm may have already happened with this community and employ the do '\", \"b' no harm policy in all of its activities.  For example, helping parents and communities identify their deaf '\", \"b' children could potentially expose a family or a deaf learner to negative attitudes and discriminatory '\", \"b' 16  Examples of stories told in ASL and in English can be found here:  https://vl2storybookapps.com '\", \"b' 17  For more on ICT and UDL, see here: '\", \"b' https://www.globalreadingnetwork.net/resources/using-information-communications-technologies-implement-univers '\", \"b' al-design-learning '\", \"b' 18  Serve and Return, Harvard Center for the Developing  Child, '\", \"b' https://developingchild.harvard.edu/science/key-concepts/serve-and-return/ '\", \"b' 15 '\", \"b' behaviors in the community.  Therefore, the Activity will need to be sensitive to this and employ due tact '\", \"b' when engaging with deaf learners, their family members, and their community members. '\", \"b' A.5.11 CREATIVE COMMONS '\", \"b' In accordance with the 2013 White House directives on making education materials open source, '\", \"b' the materials developed by the SPLD Activity must be licensed with the Creative Commons '\", \"b' Attribution (Creative Commons-By) license. Creative Commons is a non-profit that provides '\", \"b' copyright licenses that allow material developers to retain copyright and credit for the original '\", \"b' work, while allowing others to copy, distribute, and build upon the work. This licensing arrangement is '\", \"b' essential for the GOR to scale and sustain the interventions. '\", \"b' A.5.12 COLLABORATING, LEARNING, AND ADAPTATION (CLA) '\", \"b' Because this activity will be Rwanda\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first, standalone disability-inclusive education approach at scale, '\", \"b' USAID expects the Applicant to periodically review activity assumptions and adapt approaches and the '\", \"b' theory of change as new evidence emerges. CLA principles can support this responsiveness to changing '\", \"b' evidence and opportunities. SPLD should plan time to reflect, identify, and adapt to windows of '\", \"b' opportunity, challenges, or emergent evidence  . Collaboration  will include joint work planning, regular '\", \"b'19'\", \"b' partner meetings to facilitate knowledge sharing and learning. The learning and adapting processes will '\", \"b' help the partner to make adjustments or mid-term corrections to adapt to the changing environment. '\", \"b' A.6 '\", \"b' MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND LEARNING '\", \"b' Monitoring, evaluation, and learning are essential to improve performance and effectiveness, as well as to '\", \"b' provide feedback loops to inform adaptive planning and management decisions to refine activity '\", \"b' approaches. '\", \"b' A brief description of key performance management actions, such as data gathering and analysis of '\", \"b' baseline and performance data, among other monitoring strategies, should be included. A brief list of '\", \"b' standard and customized indicators to measure results at the output and outcome levels with baselines and '\", \"b' targets is also required. The Activity MEL Plan should also include the criteria that will be used to monitor '\", \"b' progress, delineate details (i.e., definition, source, collection method and frequency, etc.) for each planned '\", \"b' indicator, and clearly link each indicator to the relevant program result it will measure progress against. '\", \"b' The MEL Plan should include provisions for monitoring the following aspects of the Activity: '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Quantity and quality of individual events and resources (such as participant feedback at '\", \"b' workshops, training participant retention of target knowledge, website user footprints, and '\", \"b' feedback, etc.). '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Formative and summative evaluations that allow for the continual improvement and adaptation of '\", \"b' the intervention. '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Higher level results that indicate successful achievement over the lifetime of award (i.e., impacts '\", \"b' of activities, as appropriate). '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Measures of scalability and sustainability. '\", \"b' 19  The assessments should conform to the Early Grade Reading Assessment Toolkit, available online at '\", \"b' www.globalreadingnetwork.net/resources/early-grade-reading-assessment-egra-toolkit-second-edition '\", \"b' 16 '\", \"b' The Recipient must collect data on all applicable Foreign Assistance Standard Indicators and the custom '\", \"b' indicator \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cpercentage of children with disabilities demonstrating increased reading fluency in targeted '\", \"b' schools.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d All participant indicators must be disaggregated by sex. Student-level indicators must also be '\", \"b' disaggregated by grade, age, disability status  . '\", \"b'20'\", \"b' For example, the Applicant must include in the MEL Plan the following USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s standard indicators, as '\", \"b' applicable: '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Number of primary or secondary school learners from underserved and/or disadvantaged groups '\", \"b' benefiting from USG education assistance specifically targeted at reducing inequity.

The '\", \"b' applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s budget must include position title, salary rate, level of effort, and salary escalation factors '\", \"b' for each position.  Applicants must explain all assumptions in the Budget Narrative. The Budget '\", \"b' Narrative must demonstrate that the proposed compensation is reasonable for the services rendered '\", \"b' and consistent with what is paid for similar work in other activities of the applicant. Applicants must '\", \"b' provide their established written policies on personnel compensation.  If the applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s written '\", \"b' policies do not address a specific element of compensation that is being proposed, the Budget '\", \"b' Narrative must describe the rationale used and supporting market research. '\", \"b' 2)  Fringe Benefits and Allowances \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 (if applicable) If the applicant has a fringe benefit rate approved by '\", \"b' an agency of the U.S. Government, the applicant must use such rate and provide evidence of its '\", \"b' approval. If an applicant does not have a fringe benefit rate approved, the applicant must propose a '\", \"b' rate and explain how the applicant determined the rate. In this case, the Budget Narrative must '\", \"b' include a detailed breakdown comprised of all items of fringe benefits (e.g., superannuation, gratuity, '\", \"b' etc.) and the costs of each, expressed in U.S. dollars and as a percentage of salaries. Allowances, '\", \"b' when proposed, must be broken down by specific type and by position. '\", \"b' 3)  Travel and Transportation \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Provide details to explain the purpose of the trips, the number of trips, the '\", \"b' origin and destination, the number of individuals traveling, and the duration of the trips. Per Diem and '\", \"b' associated travel costs must be based on the applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s normal travel policies. When appropriate '\", \"b' please provide supporting documentation as an attachment, such as company travel policy, and '\", \"b' explain assumptions in the Budget Narrative. '\", \"b' 4)  Procurement or Rental of Goods (Equipment & Supplies), Services, and Real Property  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Must include '\", \"b' information on estimated types of equipment, models, supplies and the cost per unit and quantity. The '\", \"b' Budget Narrative must include the purpose of the equipment and supplies and the basis for the '\", \"b' estimates.  The Budget Narrative must support the necessity of any rental costs and reasonableness in '\", \"b' light of such factors as: rental costs of comparable property, if any; market conditions in the area; '\", \"b' alternatives available; and the type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the property leased. '\", \"b' 5)  Subawards \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Specify the budget for the portion of the program to be passed through to any '\", \"b' subrecipients. See 2 CFR 200 for assistance in determining whether the sub-tier entity is a '\", \"b' subrecipient or contractor.  The subrecipient budgets must align with the same requirements as the '\", \"b' applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s budget, including those related to fringe and indirect costs. '\", \"b' 6)  Other Direct Costs \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 This may include other costs not elsewhere specified, such as report preparation '\", \"b' costs, passports and visas fees, medical exams and inoculations, as well as any other miscellaneous '\", \"b' costs which directly benefit the program proposed by the applicant. The applicant should indicate the '\", \"b' subject, venue and duration of any proposed conferences and seminars, and their relationship to the '\", \"b' objectives of the program, along with estimates of costs.  Otherwise, the narrative should be minimal. '\", \"b' 7)   Indirect Costs \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 Applicants must indicate whether they are proposing indirect costs or will charge all '\", \"b' costs directly.  In order to better understand indirect costs please see Subpart E of 2 CFR 200. The '\", \"b' application must identify which approach they are requesting and provide the applicable supporting '\", \"b' information.  Below are the most commonly used Indirect Cost Rate methods: '\", \"b' 30 '\", \"b' Method 1 - Direct Charge Only '\", \"b' Eligibility: Any applicant '\", \"b' Initial Application Requirements: See above on direct costs '\", \"b' Method 2 - Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA) '\", \"b' Eligibility: Any applicant with a NICRA issued by a USG Agency must use that NICRA '\", \"b' Initial Application Requirements: If the applicant has a current NICRA, submit your approved '\", \"b' NICRA and the associated disclosed practices.  If your NICRA was issued by an Agency other than '\", \"b' USAID, provide the contact information for the approving Agency.  Additionally, at the Agency\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b' discretion, a provisional rate may be set forth in the award subject to audit and finalization.  See '\", \"b' USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Indirect Cost Rate Guide for  Non Profit Organizations  for  further guidance. '\", \"b' Method 3 - De minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs (MTDC) '\", \"b' Eligibility: Any applicant that does not have a current NICRA '\", \"b' Initial Application Requirements: Costs must be consistently charged as either indirect or direct costs, '\", \"b' but may not be double charged or inconsistently charged as both. If chosen, this methodology once '\", \"b' elected must be used consistently for all Federal awards until such time as a non-Federal entity '\", \"b' chooses to negotiate an indirect rate, which the non-Federal entity may apply to do at any time.  The '\", \"b' applicant must describe which cost elements it charges indirectly vs. directly.  See 2 CFR 200 for '\", \"b' further information. '\", \"b' Method 4 - Indirect Costs Charged As A Fixed Amount '\", \"b' Eligibility: Non U.S. non-profit organizations without a NICRA may request, but approval is at the '\", \"b' discretion of the AO '\", \"b' Initial Application Requirements: Provide the proposed fixed amount and a worksheet that includes '\", \"b' the following: '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Total costs incurred by the organization for the previous fiscal year and estimates for the current '\", \"b' year. '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Indirect costs (common costs that benefit the day-to-day operations of the organization, including '\", \"b' categories such as salaries and expenses of executive officers, personnel administration, and '\", \"b' accounting, or that benefit and are identifiable to more than one program or activity, such as '\", \"b' depreciation, rental costs, operations and maintenance of facilities, and telephone expenses) for '\", \"b' the previous fiscal year and estimates for the current year '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Proposed method for prorating the indirect costs equitably and consistently across all programs '\", \"b' and activities of using a base that measures the benefits of that particular cost to each program or '\", \"b' activity to which the cost applies. '\", \"b' If the applicant does not have an approved NICRA and does not elect to utilize the 10% de minimis rate, '\", \"b' the Agreement Officer will provide further instructions and may request additional supporting '\", \"b' information, including financial statements and audits, should the application still be under consideration '\", \"b' after the merit review.  USAID is under no obligation to approve the applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s requested method. '\", \"b' e)  Prior Approvals in accordance with 2 CFR 200.407 '\", \"b' Inclusion of an item of cost in the detailed application budget does not satisfy any requirements for prior '\", \"b' approval by the Agency.  If the applicant would like the award to reflect approval of any cost elements for '\", \"b' which prior written approval is specifically required for allowability, the applicant must specify and '\", \"b' 31 '\", \"b' justify that cost.  See 2 CFR 200.407 for information regarding which cost elements require prior written '\", \"b' approval. '\", \"b' f)  Approval of Subawards '\", \"b' The applicant must submit information for all subawards that it wishes to have approved at the time of '\", \"b' award. For each proposed subaward the applicant must provide the following: '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Name of organization '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Confirmation that the subrecipient does not appear on the Treasury Department\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Office of '\", \"b' Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Confirmation that the subrecipient does not have active exclusions in the System for Award '\", \"b' Management (SAM) '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Confirmation that the subrecipient is not listed in the United Nations Security designation list '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Confirmation that the subrecipient is not suspended or debarred '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Confirmation that the applicant has completed a risk assessment of the subrecipient, in '\", \"b' accordance with 2 CFR 200.332(b) '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f  Any negative findings as a result of the risk assessment and the applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plan for mitigation. '\", \"b' g)  Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and SAM Registration '\", \"b' Applicants must obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and register in the System for Award '\", \"b' Management (SAM) ( https://sam.gov/ ) in order to be  eligible to receive federal assistance, such as grants '\", \"b' and cooperative agreements. Unless an exemption applies (see ADS 303maz), applicants must be '\", \"b' registered in SAM prior to submitting an application for award for USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s consideration. Recipients '\", \"b' must maintain an active SAM registration while they have an active award. Each applicant (unless the '\", \"b' applicant is an individual or entity that is exempted from UEI/SAM requirements under 2 CFR 25.110) is '\", \"b' required to: '\", \"b' 1.  Provide a valid UEI for the applicant and all proposed sub-recipients; '\", \"b' 2.  Be registered in SAM  before  submitting its application. '\", \"b' 3.  Continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during '\", \"b' which it has an active Federal award or an application or plan under consideration by a Federal '\", \"b' awarding agency. '\", \"b' The registration process may take many weeks to complete.  Therefore, applicants are encouraged to '\", \"b' begin the process early. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements above by the time '\", \"b' USAID is ready to make an award, USAID may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive an '\", \"b' award and use that determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant. '\", \"b' Applicants can find additional resources for registering in SAM, including a Quick Start Guide and a '\", \"b' video, on  https://sam.gov/ . '\", \"b' 32 '\", \"b' a)  History of Performance '\", \"b' Only the apparently successful applicant  will be required to provide information regarding its recent '\", \"b' history of performance  for all its cost-reimbursement contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements '\", \"b' involving similar or related programs, not to exceed three ye  ars,  as follows: '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Name of the Awarding Organization; '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Award Number; '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Activity Title; '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 A brief description of the activity; '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Period of Performance; '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Award Amount; '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Reports and findings from any audits performed in the last three; and '\", \"b' \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa2 Name of at least two (2) updated professional contacts who most directly observed the work at '\", \"b' the organization for which the service was performed with complete current contact information '\", \"b' including telephone number, and e-mail address for each proposed individual. '\", \"b' If the applicant encountered problems on any of the referenced Awards, it may provide a short '\", \"b' explanation and the corrective action taken. The applicant should not provide general information on its '\", \"b' performance.  USAID reserves the right to obtain relevant information concerning an applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s history '\", \"b' of performance from any sources and may consider such information in its review of the applicant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s risk. '\", \"b' The Agency may request additional information and conduct a pre-award survey if it determines that it is '\", \"b' necessary to inform the risk assessment. '\", \"b' b)  Branding Strategy & Marking Plan '\", \"b' The apparently successful applicant will be asked to provide a Branding Strategy and Marking Plan to be '\", \"b' evaluated and approved by the Agreement Officer and incorporated into any resulting award '\", \"b' Branding Strategy and Marking Plan Pre-Award Term '\", \"b' 1.

'\", \"b' b.  The  request  for  a  Branding  Strategy,  by  the  Agreement  Officer  from  the  applicant,  confers  no  rights  to '\", \"b' the applicant and constitutes no USAID commitment to an award.

As part of supporting '\", \"b'Bangladesh in becoming self-reliant, the Community Nutrition and Health Activity will address the inequitable '\", \"b'nutrition and other health outcomes of the most vulnerable segments of the population through a targeted '\", \"b'community-health system strengthening approach. CNHA aims to strengthen sustainably the community health '\", \"b'system.    '\", \"b'A.3 SCOPE '\", \"b'1. Overview '\", \"b'USAID/Bangladesh seeks to improve the nutritional status of women and children within the first 1,000 days of '\", \"b'life, as defined as pregnancy to the child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s second birthday.  The Community Nutrition and Health Activity '\", \"b'(CNHA) will support maternal, infant and young child nutrition status by 1) strengthening public community '\", \"b'health systems2 to deliver quality nutrition, family planning and health services; 2) improving nutrition and '\", \"b'health behaviors; and 3) strengthening governance for nutrition at the national, sub-national and community '\", \"b'levels. The Activity also seeks to improve communities\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 resilience to shocks.  '\", \"b'CNHA closely aligns with the Government of Bangladesh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (GoB) efforts to improve the nutrition of the most '\", \"b'vulnerable segments of population. As other international development partners invest in nutrition, CNHA will '\", \"b'prioritize geographic areas based on nutrition and family planning data regarding the current context, inter-office '\", \"b'collaboration, priority needs and limiting overlap with other development partners\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 investments. CNHA '\", \"b'prioritizes working in hard-to-reach areas, in the USAID Zones of Influence and beyond, where the nutrition '\", \"b'and family planning (FP) needs are the greatest.  '\", \"b'1 Women and young children suffer the most from under-nutrition due to the increased demands of reproduction and rapid '\", \"b'growth, respectively. The period between a woman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pregnancy and her child\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s second birthday (the 1,000 days) is a unique '\", \"b'window of opportunity when better nutrition has the greatest impact on reducing maternal and newborn death, diseases and '\", \"b'avoiding irreversible harm. '\", \"b'2 CNHA defines community health systems as public health systems: community clinics and their outreach (domiciliary '\", \"b'services) and Union Health and Family Welfare Centers. CHNA will work with existing Government of Bangladesh health '\", \"b'structures to sustainably improve service delivery at the lowest tier of the public health system of Bangladesh.

CNHA will support scaling up of evidence-based interventions proven through previous investments, '\", \"b'including but not limited to USAID-INCA\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s community approaches, SPRING, SHOUHARDO, Alive and '\", \"b'Thrive, and SHIKHA. Where feasible, CNHA will leverage other sectoral initiatives (education, agriculture, '\", \"b'economic development) funded by USAID, other donors\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and the Government of Bangladesh, to support a '\", \"b'comprehensive, coordinated approach across programs to improve the well-being of most vulnerable '\", \"b'Bangladeshis.  '\", \"b'CNHA will build upon USAID and other international development partners\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 prior investments in social and '\", \"b'behavior change for improved nutrition and health, e.g. USAID\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Social and Behavioral Change Communication '\", \"b'(Ujjiban) Activity. It will be critical that CNHA leverages past research on key behaviors and already developed '\", \"b'social and behavior change (SBC) materials and engages with existing government structures that will contribute '\", \"b'to supporting long-term SBC activities.  '\", \"b'USAID expects applicants to explain how best to improve nutrition through multisectoral approaches, leveraging '\", \"b'other USG or international development partners, civil society and private sector during the concept note phase.

Community Groups (CGs) and Community Support Groups (CSGs), '\", \"b'composed of community representatives, are expected to provide support to the CCs.

A recent '\", \"b'evaluation of CBHCs found that CGs appear to be more active and are meeting more regularly than '\", \"b'CSGs. There is limited follow up of the work of the CSGs in several ways.

For example, socio-cultural and religious norms limit access to antenatal care for '\", \"b'married pregnant adolescents as husbands and/or mothers-in-law define when and where adolescent girls '\", \"b'may receive services. Often adolescent married pregnant women remain isolated with very limited '\", \"b'access to antenatal and postnatal care services.  '\", \"b'\\\\xe2\\\\x97\\\\x8f In some regions, awareness of CCs and the services they provide is low: Only 60% of ever-married '\", \"b'women (15-49 years) are aware of a community clinic in their locality. Awareness of community clinics '\", \"b'is lower among women in Dhaka, Sylhet, and Chattogram divisions.25  Generally, when women are '\", \"b'aware of opening hours of their CCs, only a small percentage (12 percent) are aware of which days in a '\", \"b'week a HA or FWA is available.26  The shortage and part-time presence of HAs and FWAs hinders the '\", \"b'availability and continuity of services at the CC. Thus, the limited continuity of services is one of the '\", \"b'barriers that limit utilization of services provided by CCs. The latest Demographic Health Survey '\", \"b'reported that only sixteen percent of women who were aware of community clinics visited such a clinic '\", \"b'in the 3 months before the survey.

'\", \"b'Introduction '\", \"b'Zimbabwe has made exceptional progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS.  The country is '\", \"b'estimated to have reached 96-96-930F1 against the 90-90-90 Joint United Nations Programme on '\", \"b'HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) targets, putting the country at the verge of epidemic control. The United '\", \"b'States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Zimbabwe, with funding from the '\", \"b'United States Government (USG) President\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), has '\", \"b'played a critical role in this progress through multiple program areas, including the support of '\", \"b'high-impact HIV prevention, care, and support programs targeting those most at risk of HIV '\", \"b'acquisition and poor treatment outcomes. Zimbabwe is at a pivotal moment in the epidemic. '\", \"b'Not only is it critical to continue to scale strategic prevention services to the most at risk and '\", \"b'deliver last mile HIV diagnosis and treatment services to those yet to be reached, the country '\", \"b'must plan for sustainability and adopt approaches that will make it possible to sustain these '\", \"b'gains far into the future. '\", \"b'Preventing HIV for Sustained Epidemic Control in Zimbabwe (Prevent) (hereafter, the Activity) is a '\", \"b'five-year Activity, implemented by USAID on behalf of the U.S. President\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Emergency Plan for '\", \"b'AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), that builds on best practices and lessons learned from over two decades of '\", \"b'USAID experience implementing HIV prevention, testing, treatment, and support programs for '\", \"b'priority populations in Zimbabwe.  Under the coordination of the Ministry of Health and Child '\", \"b'Care (MOHCC) and the National AIDS Council (NAC), the Activity will continue and improve '\", \"b'current efforts to reduce HIV incidence and mortality, and to increase the uptake of and '\", \"b'retention in high impact HIV services among key and priority populations in targeted '\", \"b'communities in Zimbabwe.  In addition, the Activity will help usher Zimbabwe into the next era '\", \"b'of the HIV response by implementing a range of approaches to strengthen local capacities and '\", \"b'systems necessary for sustaining HIV epidemic control including engaging the private sector for '\", \"b'sustainability, scale and effectiveness.  This Activity supports the country\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s visions as outlined in '\", \"b'Zimbabwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (ZNASP, 2021-2025). '\", \"b'A2. '\", \"b'Background '\", \"b'a. Context of HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe '\", \"b'The country has made tremendous progress towards ending AIDS as a public health threat.  The '\", \"b'number of annual new HIV infections decreased from a peak of 230,000 in 1991 to 23,000 in '\", \"b'2021, while the number of estimated AIDS deaths declined from a high of 130,000 in 2003 to '\", \"b'1 UNAIDS, 2022 '\", \"b'6 '\", \"b'20,000 in 20211F2.  Adult HIV prevalence has declined from 23.8% in 1999 to 11.6% and treatment '\", \"b'coverage continues to improve:  out of the approximately 1.3 million people living with HIV '\", \"b'(PLHIV) in Zimbabwe, 1.19 million were on ART in 20212F3.  Population level viral load suppression '\", \"b'is estimated to be 93%, up from 86% in 20193F4.   '\", \"b'Despite these impressive gains, gaps remain for particular populations in terms of access to '\", \"b'services and health outcomes.  Key populations (KP), defined here as female sex workers (FSW), '\", \"b'men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender individuals (TG), and people who inject drugs '\", \"b'(PWID) account for less than 5% of the global population, but they and their sexual partners '\", \"b'comprised 70% of the new HIV infections in 20214F5. In southern and eastern Africa, KP were '\", \"b'estimated to contribute 32% of all new infections and for all of these populations, HIV '\", \"b'prevalence was significantly higher than in the general population5F6. HIV prevalence among sex '\", \"b'workers (SW) in Zimbabwe is very high: estimated at 42.2% for all ages in 2021.6F7 HIV prevalence '\", \"b'among MSM and TG in Zimbabwe was estimated at 21% and 27.5% in 2021.7F8 Young women in '\", \"b'Zimbabwe continue to be at higher risk of HIV and suboptimal reproductive health outcomes:  '\", \"b'according to ZIMPHIA 2020, HIV prevalence was three times higher among females (6.4%) than '\", \"b'males (2.8%) aged 20-24 years. In order to reduce the number of new infections among '\", \"b'adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), concerted efforts must be made to engage men in '\", \"b'both HIV prevention and treatment activities.  '\", \"b'While TB incidence, TB/HIV co-infection and TB mortality among PLHIV have declined in recent '\", \"b'years, Zimbabwe is still grappling with a high TB burden in the country. TB continues to impact '\", \"b'PLHIV disproportionately, with PLHIV having higher TB mortality rates than their HIV negative '\", \"b'peers.  Besides PLHIV, artisanal miners, pregnant women and children are priority populations '\", \"b'that are targeted for active case finding interventions.   '\", \"b'Zimbabwe has experienced years of economic decline, which has impacted the delivery of health '\", \"b'services in many ways, including frequent shortages of basic supplies and commodities, poorly '\", \"b'maintained infrastructure, and chronically underpaid and demoralized healthcare workers. The '\", \"b'COVID-19 pandemic compounded an already difficult situation by further damaging the '\", \"b'economy and decreasing access to essential health services.  The country is currently '\", \"b'2 Zimbabwe HIV Estimates, 2021 '\", \"b'3 Zimbabwe HIV Estimates, 2021 '\", \"b'4 Zimbabwe HIV Estimates, 2021 '\", \"b'5 UNAIDS, Global AIDS Update 2022 '\", \"b'6 UNAIDS Data 2021 '\", \"b'7 UNAIDS Data 2021 '\", \"b'8 UNAIDS Data 2021 '\", \"b'7 '\", \"b'experiencing an alarming increase in the number of healthcare workers leaving the country for '\", \"b'better opportunities.  While commitment within the MOHCC to end AIDS is high, the funding '\", \"b'needs far outpace the Government\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s annual budget expenditures on health.  As a result, '\", 'b\"Zimbabwe\\'s HIV program relies on external resources from multiple donors to fund the HIV \"', \"b'response.  Globally, donor resources for the HIV response are in decline, as countries attempt to '\", \"b'respond to a myriad of global health crises such as COVID-19.  With many countries like '\", \"b'Zimbabwe at or nearing epidemic control, there is a need to actively plan for how the HIV gains '\", \"b'will be sustained. '\", \"b'The HIV response in Zimbabwe has been implemented primarily through the public sector, with '\", \"b'the support of international and local non-governmental organizations (NGO).  There is strong '\", \"b'local civil society organization (CSO) capacity for HIV service delivery, including a growing '\", \"b'number of KP-led organizations.  The private sector has not been optimally engaged in the HIV '\", \"b'response to date, but there are important ways it can and should be involved:  to reach gap '\", \"b'populations who prefer not to seek care through the public sector or NGO clinics, for market-'\", \"b'based solutions to persistent bottlenecks and as a key player in a more sustainably financed HIV '\", \"b'sector of the future. '\", \"b'b. Status of key HIV biomedical prevention interventions '\", \"b'Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision '\", \"b'Zimbabwe has made a great deal of progress with voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) '\", \"b'as an important biomedical prevention option for men.  Prior to COVID-19 the number of '\", \"b'circumcisions done per year was steadily increasing and peaked at more than 300,000 '\", \"b'procedures in 2018.  The VMMC program performance was particularly hard hit by COVID-19 '\", \"b'restrictions during the peak of the pandemic. That, coupled with the PEPFAR guidance shift to '\", \"b'stop circumcisions in the 10-14 year old age group, resulted in fewer circumcisions carried out in '\", \"b'2020-21 (approximately 125,000 circumcisions were done). Current progress towards saturation '\", \"b'(at least 80% of 15-29 year old men) varies by province, with three (Mashonaland Central, '\", \"b'Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South) approaching saturation, but still a high unmet need in '\", \"b'the seven other provinces, particularly in Harare. The VMMC program has been implemented in '\", \"b'a highly vertical manner, heavily dependent on donor financing, and the country is engaged in a '\", \"b'number of efforts to make the program more sustainable (including defining sustainability for '\", \"b'the Zimbabwe context8F9), while still focusing on rapid scale up to achieve maximum '\", \"b'epidemiological impact. Going forward, there is a need to evolve the VMMC program to more '\", \"b'effectively act as an entry point for young men for long-term engagement with health services.  '\", \"b'VMMC must become more integrated in general health services in both the public and private '\", \"b'sectors. Service delivery models should also be simplified (e.g., scale up of the Shang Ring, '\", \"b'telehealth approaches) and differentiated to respond to the specific HIV prevention needs of '\", \"b'9 Example definition of Sustainability provided by service providers in 2022:  Sustainability is the process of moving towards a '\", \"b'fully decentralized and integrated MOHCC-led health system that can provide safe, inclusive, holistic, equitable and quality '\", \"b'VMMC services to all clients who can readily access (and afford) them at their preferred health facilities, be it a private or public '\", \"b'health facility. '\", \"b'8 '\", \"b'different men. '\", \"b'Condoms '\", \"b'Zimbabwe has one of the largest distributions of male and female condoms in the Africa region, '\", \"b'estimated at 110 million per year.  USAID supports 99% of the condom market in Zimbabwe '\", \"b'through the procurement of male and female condoms for free distribution through public '\", \"b'sector health facilities and NGO programs, and procurement and operational support of the '\", \"b'Protector Plus social marketing program. Full price private sector condoms represent less than '\", \"b'1% of the condom market.  USAID also serves in a market facilitation role, providing technical '\", \"b'assistance to the MOHCC in the Total Market Approach (TMA), which aims to increase the '\", \"b'sustainability of the condom market by better targeting public and social sector subsidies and '\", \"b'removing barriers that drive out the commercial sector.  Key to the TMA is strong market '\", \"b'segmentation, based on ability to pay and accessibility, that translates into better targeting and '\", \"b'more efficient programming. The goal is to have wide choice for consumers, healthy competition '\", \"b'to keep prices of commercial condoms low, and better targeting of public sector (free) condoms '\", \"b'to people who genuinely cannot afford to pay.  However, Import Duty and value added tax (VAT) '\", \"b'are applied to commercial condoms in Zimbabwe, and when combined with the difficult fiscal '\", \"b'environment, this puts the price of commercial condoms out of reach for many people.  With '\", \"b'such a small commercial sector, the pressure for condoms remains on donor funded, socially '\", \"b'marketed, and public sector condoms, which is less sustainable in the long term.  Attempts have '\", \"b'been made to graduate the social marketing program to full cost recovery with some progress, '\", \"b'but full sustainability has been out of reach due to the complexity of managing pricing in the '\", \"b'context of rapid local currency devaluation, while still ensuring access.   '\", \"b'Condom availability does not equate to use and robust demand creation efforts, rooted in '\", \"b'effective audience segmentation, are needed.  Among men and women age 15 years and above '\", \"b'who reported having had sex with a nonmarital non-cohabitating partner in the previous 12 '\", \"b'months, 65% and 51% respectively reported using a condom.9F10 The MOHCC has recently '\", \"b'embarked on a new demand creation strategy that tailors approaches to public, socially '\", \"b'marketed and commercial condoms.  '\", \"b'Pre-exposure prophylaxis '\", \"b'Zimbabwe is actively scaling up its pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) program, primarily through '\", \"b'the public and NGO sectors, with oral PrEP (tenofovir and emtricitabine or TDF/FTC) widely '\", \"b'available, especially in locations with programming for KP and AGYW.  PrEP is a rapidly evolving '\", \"b'biomedical HIV prevention technology, with several new products in various phases of '\", \"b'development, including dual PrEP and contraceptive products.  Currently, the main users of oral '\", \"b'PrEP are SWs, MSM and AGYW, but it is available to anyone who requests it based on individual '\", \"b'assessment of risk. The country recently completed a pilot on acceptability of the Dapivirine '\", \"b'PrEP Ring among AGYW, and there are plans to introduce long-acting cabotegravir (CAB PrEP) in '\", \"b'10 ZIMPHIA, 2020 '\", \"b'9 '\", \"b'the coming year.  While uptake of PrEP continues to grow annually,10F11 oral PrEP continuation has '\", \"b'been a challenge due to a variety of factors such as daily pill burden, stigma, accessibility, among '\", \"b'others.  Increased delivery options for PrEP, including simplified regimens, and better integration '\", \"b'with related health services, are expected to result in greater uptake and regular use by at-risk '\", \"b'populations, and be a game changer in the field of HIV prevention. '\", \"b'DREAMS '\", \"b'Zimbabwe has implemented the Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-Free, Mentored and '\", \"b'Safe (DREAMS) program for AGYW since 2015, in a total of 16 districts, with USAID supporting '\", \"b'12.  DREAMS11F12 is PEPFAR\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s flagship approach to reducing AGYW\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s vulnerability to HIV infection '\", \"b'that uses a multisectoral and comprehensive approach that layers interventions addressing '\", \"b'individual, community and structural factors that increase AGYW\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s HIV risk including gender '\", \"b'inequality, GBV, and limited access to education and economic opportunities.  DREAMS targets '\", \"b'the most vulnerable AGYW through the use of standardized screening and enrolment tools.  '\", \"b'Interventions provided to AGYW through DREAMS include HIV and GBV prevention, GBV '\", \"b'response services, basic financial literacy and comprehensive economic strengthening, '\", \"b'education assistance, and the provision of AGYW-friendly HIV testing (HTS), PrEP, sexual '\", \"b'reproductive health (SRH), inclusive of family planning (FP) and sexually transmitted infection '\", \"b'(STI) services.  DREAMS services are delivered through schools, community safe spaces, health '\", \"b'facilities and outreach services.  DREAMS also supports community norms change activities, '\", \"b'interventions targeting caregivers of adolescents and male sexual partners of AGYW.  USAID has '\", \"b'multiple partners implementing DREAMS, split by geography and/or technical area.  CDC '\", \"b'supports DREAMS in four additional districts.  USAID supports national and district level program '\", \"b'coordination, technical assistance for strategic information, and the Zimbabwe DREAMS '\", \"b'database, which is utilized by all USG DREAMS IPs for tracking layered service provision among '\", \"b'unique AGYW.  As a PEPFAR program, the USG jointly provided one or more DREAMS services to '\", \"b'229,573 AGYW in FY22.  DREAMS is jointly led and coordinated by MOHCC and NAC and there '\", \"b'are well established coordination structures for sharing best practices and jointly '\", \"b'troubleshooting challenges. '\", \"b'Modeling data of new HIV diagnoses in antenatal care among AGYW since 2015 continue to '\", \"b'show impressive declines in DREAMS geographic areas in the 10 original focus countries. As of '\", \"b'Worlds AIDS Day 2020, all DREAMS geographic areas showed a decline of new HIV diagnoses '\", \"b'among AGYW, and the majority (62%) showed a decline of greater than 40%.  Alongside these '\", \"b'successes, there is a need to reflect on how to effectively scale DREAMS to reach more AGYW, '\", \"b'efficiencies, strategic partnerships and other opportunities to strengthen sustainability.  '\", \"b'c. United States Government contribution to the HIV response in Zimbabwe '\", \"b'USAID has played a critical role in HIV prevention and treatment for priority populations in '\", \"b'Zimbabwe for more than two decades.  The focus of this programming has evolved significantly '\", \"b'11 In FY22 PEPFAR supported more than 75,000 new PrEP users, nearly doubling FY21 reach of 38,000 '\", \"b'12 DREAMS Guidance, PEPFAR, Updated March 2021 '\", \"b'10 '\", \"b'over time in response to the commencement of PEPFAR, the changing landscape of HIV in the '\", \"b'country, our understanding of sub-populations and their risk behaviors, and the introduction of '\", \"b'new prevention products and treatment regimens.

In addition, increased engagement of the private sector will alleviate '\", \"b'overburdened public sector sites. '\", \"b'The Activity is complementary to other HIV awards that focus on HIV service delivery in the '\", \"b'public sector, and several non-clinical, multi-sectoral community awards also funded through '\", \"b'PEPFAR. '\", \"b'e.

The '\", \"b'Activity will serve as a pivotal implementation mechanism for USG support to control the HIV '\", \"b'epidemic in Zimbabwe, in collaboration with other USAID and PEPFAR activities, including '\", \"b'related projects implemented by U.S. Centers for Disease Control, as well as a range of other '\", \"b'stakeholders, to maximize synergies and share program learning and best practices.  The Global '\", \"b'Fund is a major source of support to the national HIV response, allocating Zimbabwe '\", \"b'approximately $425 million dollars over 3 years (2020-2022) to combat HIV.  Through the annual '\", \"b'COP process and quarterly performance review meetings with MOHCC, NAC, civil society, '\", \"b'multilateral and other development partners, the PEPFAR inter-agency team ensures '\", \"b'investments towards Zimbabwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s HIV response are complementary, not duplicative and in '\", \"b'alignment with national strategies and plans.  '\", \"b'A3. '\", \"b'Target populations '\", \"b'The primary target populations for this Activity are key populations including SWs in their '\", \"b'diversity and their sexual partners, MSM, TG individuals, people who use/inject drugs '\", \"b'(PWUID), AGYW, and at-risk young men.   '\", \"b'Secondary target populations include health care providers, policy makers and CSOs. '\", \"b'Sex Workers '\", \"b'Zimbabwe has invested in HIV programming for SW for many years and the program, led by KP '\", \"b'competent CSOs, is mature with strong stakeholder involvement.  At a societal level there is a '\", \"b'greater acceptance of sex work that has enabled more progress in the areas of reproductive '\", \"b'health and rights and HIV service availability.  As a result, engagement in HIV services is strong, '\", \"b'but SWs remain the most vulnerable to HIV, particularly young sex workers.

'\", \"b'13 '\", \"b'continue even though they are at risk.  In addition, there are legal restrictions on sex work in '\", \"b'Zimbabwe that can leave SW vulnerable to harassment and abuse and with few protections.   '\", \"b'Men who have Sex with Men & Transgender Individuals '\", \"b'While the Constitution of Zimbabwe acknowledges all citizens\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 inherent dignity and guarantees '\", \"b'the right to have that dignity respected, persons of the same sex are prohibited from marrying '\", \"b'one another and this has been used as the constitutional basis for denying the rights of LGBTQI '\", \"b'people in the country.  Zimbabwean law criminalizes LGBTQI persons and sex between men is a '\", \"b'crime.  The restrictive legal environment has been compounded by the politicization of same sex '\", \"b'relations among some politicians and religious leaders. There are no state services or programs '\", \"b'specifically for the LGBTQI community.  Societal stigma towards homosexuality remains very '\", \"b'prevalent in Zimbabwe and little has been done to normalize LGBTQI identities.  In recent years '\", \"b'there has been an opening of space for LGBTQI voices in the HIV programming space and HIV '\", \"b'service availability has improved--largely due to CSO and development partner advocacy.  The '\", \"b'MOHCC now recognizes the importance of KP programming and is making efforts to integrate KP '\", \"b'friendly services in the public sector.  These gains are fragile, however, and significant structural '\", \"b'barriers exist that prevent access to services and impede sustainability of the HIV response. '\", \"b'People who Use and Inject Drugs '\", \"b'The ZNASP 2020-2025 identifies PWUID as a KP group within the HIV response, but there is '\", \"b'limited information about their situation in Zimbabwe. According to a recent Situational '\", \"b'Analysis,13F14 the most commonly used substances were cannabis, alcohol, cough syrup, crystal '\", \"b'meth, and to a lesser extent, pharmaceutical drugs.  More than a third of PWUID (and more than '\", \"b'half of the women) interviewed had injected drugs (mostly crystal meth and pharmaceuticals). '\", \"b'Sharing of injecting materials, unsafe discarding, and unsafe injecting practices were frequently '\", \"b'reported. The study documented an overlap of people who use drugs and other KP such as SWs '\", \"b'and LGBTIQ communities, linkages between drug use and sex work, transactional sex, '\", \"b'unprotected sex, sex with multiple partners and sexual violence.  There are no programs or '\", \"b'services that specifically address the needs of PWUID and harm reduction services do not exist '\", \"b'currently in Zimbabwe.  While the size of the population of PWUID is not known, this is a '\", \"b'population that must be prioritized in the HIV program going forward. '\", \"b'Adolescent Girls and Young Women '\", \"b'Multiple, interrelated factors cause AGYW to be vulnerable to HIV, including low risk perception, '\", \"b'poor access to education and economic opportunities, biological susceptibility, high rates of '\", \"b'GBV, child marriage and early childbearing, and social and gender norms that limit AGYW\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s '\", \"b'agency.

Nearly one in four females ages 13\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9324 (23.3%) who experienced pressured or '\", \"b'physically forced sex became pregnant because of the first or the most recent incident.  AGYW '\", \"b'experiencing sexual violence face many barriers to receiving help, including stigma, limited '\", \"b'adolescent friendly services, and long distances, resulting in sub-optimal access to post exposure '\", \"b'prophylaxis (PEP). Emergency contraception is widely available over the counter at private '\", \"b'pharmacies and pharmacists report very high uptake; by contrast, PEP is only available with a '\", \"b'prescription, which is a missed opportunity for HIV prevention among AGYW.   '\", \"b'Men '\", \"b'In Zimbabwe, men have lower knowledge of their HIV status (90%) and lower antiretroviral '\", \"b'treatment (ART) coverage (86%) as compared to women.16F17  Newly diagnosed HIV positive men '\", \"b'have lower linkage to ART (91%) and lower viral load coverage (59%) as compared to women.17F18 '\", \"b'These data point to persistent challenges in care-seeking and there is a need to develop '\", \"b'interventions and client-centered service models that respond to their needs.  The population of '\", \"b'men is heterogeneous; particular subpopulations of interest for this Activity are male sexual '\", \"b'partners of AGYW, including those living with HIV and not virally suppressed, male sexual '\", \"b'partners of SWs, and MSM, including those who do not identify as such.
